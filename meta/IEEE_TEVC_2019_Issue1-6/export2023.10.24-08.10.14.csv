In order to exploit the similar sparsity pattern between different tasks, this paper establishes an evolutionary multitasking framework to simultaneously optimize multiple sparse reconstruction tasks using a single population. In the proposed method, the evolutionary algorithm aims to search the locations of nonzero components or rows instead of searching sparse vector or matrix directly. Then the within-task and between-task genetic transfer operators are employed to reinforce the exchange of genetic material belonging to the same or different tasks. The proposed method can solve multiple measurement vector problems efficiently because the length of decision vector is independent of the number of measurement vectors. Finally, a case study on hyperspectral image unmixing is investigated in an evolutionary multitasking setting. It is natural to consider a sparse unmixing problem in a homogeneous region as a task. Experiments on signal reconstruction and hyperspectral image unmixing demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multitasking framework for sparse reconstruction.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2881955","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772393); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0802200); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2018ZDXM-GY-045); Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Center; Nanyang Technological University; National Research Foundation Singapore(grant numbers:AISG-RP-2018-00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8540026","Evolutionary algorithm;hyperspectral unmixing;multitasking optimization;sparse reconstruction","Multitasking;Optimization;Task analysis;Image reconstruction;Hyperspectral imaging;Sociology;Statistics","evolutionary computation;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image reconstruction;optimisation;search problems;sparse matrices;vectors","sparse vector;multiple measurement vector problems;evolutionary multitasking sparse reconstruction;evolutionary algorithm;genetic transfer operators;optimization;nonzero components;sparse matrix;hyperspectral image","","51","","58","IEEE","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such a design, the degraded performance of one would deteriorate the other, and only solutions with both are able to improve the performance of MaOEAs. Unfortunately, it is not easy to constantly maintain a population of solutions with both convergence and diversity. In this paper, an MaOEA based on two independent stages is proposed for effectively solving many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs), where the convergence and diversity are addressed in two independent and sequential stages. To achieve this, we first propose a nondominated dynamic weight aggregation method by using a genetic algorithm, which is capable of finding the Pareto-optimal solutions for MaOPs with concave, convex, linear and even mixed Pareto front shapes, and then these solutions are employed to learn the Pareto-optimal subspace for the convergence. Afterward, the diversity is addressed by solving a set of single-objective optimization problems with reference lines within the learned Pareto-optimal subspace. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a series of experiments are conducted against six state-of-the-art MaOEAs on benchmark test problems. The results show the significantly improved performance of the proposed algorithm over the peer competitors. In addition, the proposed algorithm can focus directly on a chosen part of the objective space if the preference area is known beforehand. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can also be used to effectively find the nadir points.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2882166","Marsden Fund(grant numbers:VUW1209,VUW1509,VUW1615); Huawei Industry Fund(grant numbers:E2880/3663); Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:209862/3580,213150/3662); National Natural Science Fund of China for Distinguished Young Scholar(grant numbers:61625204); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61803277); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8540041","Many-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm;nadir point;Pareto-optimal subspace;two-stage method","Convergence;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Sociology;Statistics;Sun;Heuristic algorithms","convergence;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);Pareto optimisation","independent stages;sequential stages;nondominated dynamic weight aggregation method;genetic algorithm;Pareto-optimal solutions;single-objective optimization problems;learned Pareto-optimal subspace;benchmark test problems;objective space;two-stage evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary process;MaOEA;degraded performance;many-objective optimization problems;MaOP","","83","","48","IEEE","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to traditional dynamic optimization problems, where the changes are caused by some objective factors, the changes in such incremental optimization problems (IOPs) are usually caused by the modifications made by the decision makers during the design process. While existing work in the literature is mainly focused on traditional dynamic optimization, little research has been dedicated to solving such IOPs. In this paper, we study how to adopt cooperative coevolution to efficiently solve a specific type of IOPs, namely, those with increasing decision variables. First, we present a benchmark function generator on the basis of some basic formulations of IOPs with increasing decision variables and exploitable modular structure. Then, we propose a contribution-based cooperative coevolutionary framework coupled with an incremental grouping method for dealing with them. On one hand, the benchmark function generator is capable of generating various benchmark functions with various characteristics. On the other hand, the proposed framework is promising in solving such problems in terms of both optimization accuracy and computational efficiency.

The phylogenetic inference problem can be seen as an optimization problem, searching for the most qualified tree among all the possible topologies according to a selected criterion. These criteria can be based on different principles. Due to the combinatorial number of possible topologies, diverse heuristics and meta-heuristics have been proposed to find approximated solutions according to one criterion. However, these methods may result in several phylogeny trees which could be in conflict with one another. In order to deal with this problem, models based on multiobjective optimization with different configurations have been used. In this paper, we propose an ad-hoc multiobjective memetic algorithm (MO-MA) to infer phylogeny using two objectives: 1) maximum parsimony and 2) likelihood. Several population operators and local search strategies are proposed and evaluated in order to measure their contribution to the algorithm. Additionally, we perform a comparison among different configurations and tree rearrangement strategies. The results show that the proposed MO-MA is able to identify a Pareto set of solutions that include new trees which were nondominated by solutions from the current state of the art single-objective optimization tools. Furthermore, the MO-MA improves the results presented in the literature for multiobjective approaches in all of the studied data sets.

Preference information provided by a decision maker can guide the search for preferred regions of the Pareto front and accelerate the convergence of the population. In this paper, a new variant of the Pareto dominance relation, called preference angle and reference information-based dominance, is proposed to create a stricter partial order among nondominated solutions. In the proposed method, the Euclidean distance and angle information between candidate solutions and reference points are calculated to evaluate the degree of convergence and population diversity, respectively. In addition, an adaptive threshold is designed to adjust the judgment condition of ar-dominance using an iterative process in a prespecified interval. The proposed algorithm increases the convergence speed of the population and reduces the number of solutions in the nonpreferred region. Comparative evaluation experiments are presented with respect to two performance metrics for a variety of benchmark test problems and real-world aluminum electrolytic production cases.

The basic idea of SAEAs is the integration of nature-inspired searching ability of evolutionary algorithms and prediction ability of surrogate models. This paper proposes a novel evolutionary sampling assisted optimization (ESAO) method which combines the two abilities to consider global exploration and local exploitation. Differential evolution is employed to generate offspring using mutation and crossover operators. A global radial basis functions surrogate model is built for prescreening of the offspring’s objective function values and identifying the best one, which will be evaluated with the true function. The best offspring will replace its parent’s position in the population if its function value is smaller than that of its parent. A local surrogate model is then built with selected current best solutions. An optimizer is applied to find the optimum of the local model. The optimal solution is then evaluated with the true function. Besides, a better point found in the local search will be added into the population in the global search. Global and local searches will alternate if one search cannot lead to a better solution. Comprehensive analysis is conducted to study the mechanism of ESAO and insights are gained on different local surrogates. The proposed algorithm is compared with two state-of-the-art SAEAs on a series of high-dimensional problems and results show that ESAO behaves better both in effectiveness and robustness on most of the test problems. Besides, ESAO is applied to an airfoil optimization problem to show its effectiveness.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2890818","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51375389,51875466,51805436); China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8603839","Evolutionary algorithms (EAs);evolutionary sampling;high-dimensional expensive problems;surrogate models","Computational modeling;Optimization;Sociology;Statistics;Predictive models;Adaptation models","aerodynamics;aerospace components;design engineering;evolutionary computation;mechanical engineering computing;radial basis function networks;search problems","novel evolutionary sampling assisted optimization method;high-dimensional expensive problems;surrogate models;crossover operators;optimal solution;local search;global search;airfoil optimization problem;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms;mutation operators;state-of-the-art SAEA;ESAO method;differential evolution;global radial basis functions surrogate model;offspring objective function value","","85","","50","IEEE","6 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It requires less adversarial information (a black-box attack) and can fool more types of networks due to the inherent features of DE. The results show that 67.97% of the natural images in Kaggle CIFAR-10 test dataset and 16.04% of the ImageNet (ILSVRC 2012) test images can be perturbed to at least one target class by modifying just one pixel with 74.03% and 22.91% confidence on average. We also show the same vulnerability on the original CIFAR-10 dataset. Thus, the proposed attack explores a different take on adversarial machine learning in an extreme limited scenario, showing that current DNNs are also vulnerable to such low dimension attacks. Besides, we also illustrate an important application of DE (or broadly speaking, evolutionary computation) in the domain of adversarial machine learning: creating tools that can effectively generate low-cost adversarial attacks against neural networks for evaluating robustness.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2890858","Collaboration Hubs for International Program of SICORP; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Kyushu University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8601309","Convolutional neural network;differential evolution (DE);image recognition;information security","Perturbation methods;Neural networks;Robustness;Image color analysis;Image recognition;Additives","evolutionary computation;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object recognition","DNN;CIFAR-10 dataset;deep neural networks;low-cost adversarial attacks;low dimension attacks;extreme limited scenario;adversarial machine learning;ILSVRC 2012;ImageNet test images;natural images;adversarial information;differential evolution;one-pixel adversarial perturbations;input vector;pixel attack","","989","","63","IEEE","4 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nowadays, the scale of the WDN of a city grows dramatically along with the city expansion, which brings heavy pressure to its optimal design. In order to solve the large-scale WDN optimization problem, a cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm is proposed in this paper. First, an iterative trace-based decomposition method is specially designed by utilizing the information of water tracing to divide a large-scale network into small subnetworks. Since little domain knowledge is required, the decomposition method has great adaptability to multiform networks. Meanwhile, during optimization, the proposed algorithm can gradually refine the decomposition to make it more accurate. Second, a new fitness function is devised to handle the pressure constraint of the problem. The function transforms the constraint into a part of the objective to punish the infeasible solutions.

"Handling Constrained Multiobjective Optimization Problems With Constraints in Both the Decision and Objective Spaces","Z. -Z. Liu; Y. Wang","School of Automation, Central South University, Changsha, China; School of Automation, Central South University, Changsha, China","IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","1 Oct 2019","2019","23","5","870","884","Constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) are frequently encountered in real-world applications, which usually involve constraints in both the decision and objective spaces. However, current artificial CMOPs never consider constraints in the decision space (i.e., decision constraints) and constraints in the objective space (i.e., objective constraints) at the same time. As a result, they have a limited capability to simulate practical scenes. To remedy this issue, a set of CMOPs, named DOC, is constructed in this paper. It is the first attempt to consider both the decision and objective constraints simultaneously in the design of artificial CMOPs. Specifically, in DOC, various decision constraints (e.g., inequality constraints, equality constraints, linear constraints, and nonlinear constraints) are collected from real-world applications, thus making the feasible region in the decision space have different properties (e.g., nonlinear, extremely small, and multimodal). On the other hand, some simple and controllable objective constraints are devised to reduce the feasible region in the objective space and to make the Pareto front have diverse characteristics (e.g., continuous, discrete, mixed, and degenerate). As a whole, DOC poses a great challenge for a constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (CMOEA) to obtain a set of well-distributed and well-converged feasible solutions. In order to enhance current CMOEAs' performance on DOC, a simple and efficient two-phase framework, named ToP, is proposed in this paper. In ToP, the first phase is implemented to find the promising feasible area by transforming a CMOP into a constrained single-objective optimization problem. Then in the second phase, a specific CMOEA is executed to obtain the final solutions. ToP is applied to four state-of-the-art CMOEAs, and the experimental results suggest that it is quite effective.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2894743","Central South University(grant numbers:2018CX010); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61673397); Hunan Provincial Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:2016JJ1018); Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Intelligent Robots and Systems(grant numbers:2018IRS06); Graduate Innovation Fund of Hunan Province of China(grant numbers:CX2017B062); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8624421","Constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs);constraint-handling technique;decision space;evolutionary algorithms;objective space","Pareto optimization;Linear programming;Automobiles;Aerospace electronics;Evolutionary computation;Decision feedback equalizers","constraint handling;evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation","constrained multiobjective optimization problems;objective space;CMOP;decision space;decision constraints;constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;single-objective optimization problem;objective constraints;Pareto front;CMOEAs;two-phase framework;ToP","","182","","53","IEEE","23 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first propose an algorithm to optimize the total loss value using a modified 0-1 loss function in a 1-D space for classification. We then extend this algorithm for multidimensional classification using an evolutionary algorithm. The proposed evolutionary algorithm aims to find a hyperplane that best classifies instances while minimizing the classification risk. We test particle swarm optimization, evolutionary strategy (ES), and covariance matrix adaptation ES for optimization purposes. After parameter selection, we compare our results with well-established and state-of-the-art classification algorithms, for both binary and multiclass classification, on 23 benchmark classification problems, with and without noise and outliers. We also compare these methods on a seizure detection task for 12 epileptic patients. Results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is significantly (Wilcoxon test) better than all other methods in almost all problems tested. We also show that the proposed algorithm is significantly more robust against noise and outliers comparing to other methods. The running time of the algorithm is within a reasonable range for the solution of real-world classification problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2895298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8625456","Discriminative classification;evolutionary algorithms (EAs);supervised learning","Optimization;Support vector machines;Particle separators;Evolutionary computation;Training;Logistics;Fasteners","biology computing;covariance matrices;evolutionary computation;particle swarm optimisation","classification algorithms;Wilcoxon test;epileptic patients;real-world classification problems;multiclass classification;binary classification;covariance matrix adaptation ES;particle swarm optimization;classification risk;hyperplane that best classifies instances;multidimensional classification;evolutionary algorithm;optimal-margin evolutionary classifier","","7","","49","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This framework models a realistic market into which companies, the external dynamic influences, invest resources in order to bolster their product's standing and increase their market share. The dynamic influences change in each time step of the game, and directly modify the payoff matrix of the population's interactions. The model can learn from real data how each influence affects the market, and can be used to simulate and predict the outcome of a real system. We specifically analyze how a new technology can compete and attempt to unseat an entrenched technology as the market leader. We establish a relationship between the external influences and the population payoff matrix and show how the system can be implemented to predict outcomes in a real market by simulating the rise of the Android mobile operating system over its primary competition, the iPhone, from 2009 to 2017.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2881973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8540013","Evolutionary game theory;product markets;replicator dynamics","Sociology;Statistics;Companies;Computational modeling;Data models;Predictive models;Pricing","game theory;industrial economics;investment;organisational aspects;smart phones","market share;market leader;replicator evolution;replicator dynamics model;dynamic influences;payoff matrix;product markets;invest resource;Android mobile operating system;game theory","","","","13","IEEE","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ray","School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia; School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia; School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia","IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","1 Oct 2019","2019","23","5","904","912","A number of real-world problems involve extremization of multiple conflicting objectives, referred to as multiobjective optimization problems. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been widely adopted to obtain Pareto front (PF) approximation for such problems. An indispensable step in development and evaluation of MOEAs is benchmarking, which involves comparisons with peer algorithms using performance metrics, such as hypervolume (HV) and inverted generational distance (IGD). However, the de-facto practice is to use the final population of an algorithm for evaluating these metrics even though a better PF approximation may exist within the archive of all evaluated solutions. In a recent study, a distance-based subset selection (DSS) method was discussed for selecting prespecified number of solutions from an archive for benchmarking. This letter aims to contribute toward this direction in two ways. First is to develop a theoretical understanding of DSS and reveal some of its interesting and desirable properties. These include conditional equivalence to optimal HV/IGD subset selection, inclusion of PF extremities and invariance to convexity/concavity and orientation of the PF. Secondly, we present numerical experiments on problems with regular and irregular PFs up to ten objectives, and compare the approach with other selection techniques to demonstrate its potential benefits. The results clearly indicate the importance of considering the archive of solutions and appropriate selection mechanisms, in particular for problems with irregular PFs, to avoid misjudgments about relative performances. With increasing emphasis on tackling such problems in the field, we believe that this observation and analysis is timely and significant, not only for benchmarking, but also for subsequent improvements in decision-making and algorithm design.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2883094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8543664","Benchmarking;evolutionary computation;many-objective optimization;multi-objective optimization;subset selection","Sociology;Statistics;Benchmark testing;Approximation algorithms;Measurement;Optimization;Sorting","evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation","multiobjective optimization problems;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;MOEAs;Pareto front approximation;peer algorithms;performance metrics;generational distance;PF approximation;distance-based subset selection method;PF extremities;selection techniques;selection mechanisms","","40","","19","IEEE","23 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
