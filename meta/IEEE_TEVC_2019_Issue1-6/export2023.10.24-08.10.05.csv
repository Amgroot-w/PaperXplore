In this paper, an IGD indicator-based evolutionary algorithm for solving many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) has been proposed. Specifically, the IGD indicator is employed in each generation to select the solutions with favorable convergence and diversity. In addition, a computationally efficient dominance comparison method is designed to assign the rank values of solutions along with three newly proposed proximity distance assignments. Based on these two designs, the solutions are selected from a global view by linear assignment mechanism to concern the convergence and diversity simultaneously. In order to facilitate the accuracy of the sampled reference points for the calculation of IGD indicator, we also propose an efficient decomposition-based nadir point estimation method for constructing the Utopian Pareto front (PF) which is regarded as the best approximate PF for real-world MaOPs at the early stage of the evolution. To evaluate the performance, a series of experiments is performed on the proposed algorithm against a group of selected state-of-the-art many-objective optimization algorithms over optimization problems with 8-, 15-, and 20-objective. Experimental results measured by the chosen performance metrics indicate that the proposed algorithm is very competitive in addressing MaOPs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2791283","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201506240048); Miaozi Project in Science and Technology Innovation Program of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:16-YCG061); National Natural Science Foundation Fund of China for Distinguished Young Scholar(grant numbers:61625204); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61432012,U1435213); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8249827","Inverted generational distance (IGD);linear assignment problem (LAP);many-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm;nadir point","Convergence;Optimization;Estimation;Evolutionary computation;Approximation algorithms;Sorting;Algorithm design and analysis","convergence;evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation","efficient decomposition-based nadir point estimation method;IGD indicator-based evolutionary algorithm;many-objective optimization problems;inverted generational distance;many-objective evolutionary algorithms;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;proximity distance assignments;linear assignment mechanism;Utopian Pareto front;dominance comparison method","","283","","71","IEEE","8 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In practice, it is common that different subcomponents of a large-scale problem have imbalanced contributions to the global fitness. Thus, how to utilize such imbalance and concentrate efforts on optimizing important subcomponents becomes an important issue for improving performance of cooperative co-EA, especially in distributed computing environment. In this paper, we propose a two-layer distributed CC (dCC) architecture with adaptive computing resource allocation for large-scale optimization. The first layer is the dCC model which takes charge of calculating the importance of subcomponents and accordingly allocating resources. An effective allocating algorithm is designed which can adaptively allocate computing resources based on a periodic contribution calculating method. The second layer is the pool model which takes charge of making fully utilization of imbalanced resource allocation. Within this layer, two different conformance policies are designed to help optimizers use the assigned computing resources efficiently.

Instead, surrogate models must be built based on historical data to approximate the objective functions and no new data will be available during the optimization process. Such problems are known as offline data-driven optimization problems. Since the surrogate models solely depend on the given historical data, the optimization algorithm is able to search only in a very limited decision space during offline data-driven optimization. This paper proposes a new offline data-driven evolutionary algorithm to make the full use of the offline data to guide the search. To this end, a surrogate management strategy based on ensemble learning techniques developed in machine learning is adopted, which builds a large number of surrogate models before optimization and adaptively selects a small yet diverse subset of them during the optimization to achieve the best local approximation accuracy and reduce the computational complexity. Our experimental results on the benchmark problems and a transonic airfoil design example show that the proposed algorithm is able to handle offline data-driven optimization problems with up to 100 decision variables.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2834881","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/M017869/1); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61590922); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8357456","Ensemble;evolutionary algorithm (EA);offline data-driven optimization;radial basis function networks (RBFNs);surrogate","Optimization;Data models;Bagging;Predictive models;Computational modeling;Numerical models;Approximation algorithms","approximation theory;computational complexity;data analysis;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;search problems","offline data-driven optimization problems;machine learning;transonic airfoil design;computational complexity;local approximation;ensemble learning techniques;offline data-driven evolutionary optimization;surrogate management strategy","","134","","77","IEEE","10 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a modification of them, this paper presents a new set of test problems mDTLZ1-mDTLZ4 to avoid the two special characteristics. Using these new test problems, we investigate the performance of three representative multiobjective evolutionary algorithms NSGA-II, MOEA/D-Tch, and SMS-EMOA. Experimental results indicate that the performance of NSGA-II and MOEA/D-Tch deteriorates on mDTLZ1-mDTLZ4. Subsequently, our analysis reveals that there exist the hardly dominated boundaries in each of mDTLZ1-mDTLZ4, which hinder the approximation of Pareto dominance-based algorithms and Tchebycheff-decomposition-based algorithms. Furthermore, we summarize that the hardly dominated boundary should be an often encountered problem feature in multiobjective optimization.

The proposed method transforms the original search space, such as a set of permutations or binary vectors, to Rk (with k = 2 or 3 in practice) while aiming to preserve spatial relationships existing in the original space. The LDEE method uses the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to transform solutions from the original search space to the Euclidean one. In this paper, it is mathematically shown that the assumptions underlying the t-SNE method are valid in the case of permutation spaces with the Mallows distribution. The same is true for other metric spaces provided that the distribution of points is assumed to be normal with respect to the adopted metric. The embedding obtained using t-SNE is further refined to ensure visual separation of individual solutions. The visualization obtained using the LDEE method can be used for analyzing the behavior of the population in a population-based metaheuristic, the working of the genetic operators, etc. Examples of visualizations obtained using this method for the four peaks problem, the firefighter problem, the knapsack problem, the quadratic assignment problem, and the traveling salesman problem are presented in this paper.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2846636","Wrocław Centre for Networking and Supercomputing (http://wcss.pl)(grant numbers:407); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8382323","Combinatorial optimization;Euclidean embedding;search space visualization","Optimization;Visualization;Sociology;Statistics;Measurement;Data visualization;Search problems","combinatorial mathematics;genetic algorithms;knapsack problems;optimisation;search problems;stochastic processes","low-dimensional euclidean embedding;combinatorial optimization;combinatorial search;original search space;LDEE method;t-SNE method;permutation spaces;visual separation;search space visualization;binary vectors;knapsack problem;t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding","","13","","32","IEEE","12 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we propose an adaptive sorting-based environmental selection strategy. Solutions in each subpopulation (partitioned by reference vectors) are sorted based on their convergence. Those with better convergence are further sorted based on their diversity, then being selected according to their sorting levels. Second, we provide an adaptive promising subpopulation sorting-based environmental selection strategy for problems which may have irregular PFs. This strategy provides additional sorting-based selection effort on promising subpopulations after the general environmental selection process. Third, we extend the algorithm to handle constraints.

The task of bilevel optimization is to find the optimum of the upper-level problem, subject to the optimality of the corresponding lower-level problem. This nested nature introduces many difficulties such as nonconvexity and disconnectedness, and poses great challenges to traditional optimization methods. Using evolutionary algorithms in bilevel optimization has been demonstrated to be very promising in recent years. However, these algorithms suffer from low efficiency since they usually require a huge number of function evaluations. This paper proposes a bilevel covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy to handle bilevel optimization problems. A search distribution sharing mechanism is designed so that we can extract a priori knowledge of the lower-level problem from the upper-level optimizer, which significantly reduces the number of function evaluations. We also propose a refinement-based elite preservation mechanism to trace the elite and avoid inaccurate solutions. Comparisons with five state-of-the-art algorithms on 22 benchmark problems and two real-world applications are carried out to test the performance of the proposed approach.

In this paper, we focus on input uncertainty, such as in manufacturing, where the actual manufactured product may differ from the specified design but should still function well. Estimating a solution's expected fitness in such a case is challenging, especially if the fitness function is expensive to evaluate, and its analytic form is unknown. One option is to average over a number of scenarios, but this is computationally expensive. The archive sample approximation method reduces the required number of fitness evaluations by reusing previous evaluations stored in an archive. The main challenge in the application of this method lies in determining the locations of additional samples drawn in each generation to enrich the information in the archive and reduce the estimation error. In this paper, we use the Wasserstein distance metric to approximate the possible benefit of a potential sample location on the estimation error, and propose new sampling strategies based on this metric. Contrary to previous studies, we consider a sample's contribution for the entire population, rather than inspecting each individual separately. This also allows us to dynamically adjust the number of samples to be collected in each generation. An empirical comparison with several previously proposed archive-based sample approximation methods demonstrates the superiority of our approaches.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2849331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8390941","Archive sample approximation (ASA);average-case robustness;uncertainty;Wasserstein distance","Robustness;Estimation error;Measurement;Uncertainty;Sociology;Statistics","approximation theory;optimisation;sampling methods;search problems","robust solutions searching;approximation method;optimization problems;sampling strategies;fitness evaluations;analytic form;fitness function;input uncertainty;archive-based sample approximation methods;estimation error;potential sample location","","10","","27","IEEE","20 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

SPL involves easier samples into training at first and then gradually takes more complex ones into consideration. Current SPL regimes incorporate a self-paced (SP) regularizer into the learning objective with a gradually increasing pace parameter. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain the solution path of the SPL regime and determine where to optimally stop this increasing process. In this paper, a multiobjective SPL method is proposed to optimize the loss function and the SP regularizer simultaneously. A decomposition-based multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to simultaneously optimize the two objectives for obtaining the solutions. In the proposed method, a polynomial soft weighting regularizer is proposed to penalize the loss. Theoretical studies are conducted to show that the previous regularizers are roughly particular cases of the proposed polynomial soft weighting regularizer family. Then an implicit decomposition method is proposed to search the solutions with respect to the sample number involved into training. A set of solutions can be obtained by the proposed method and naturally constitute the solution path of the SPL regime. Then a satisfactory solution can be naturally obtained from these solutions by utilizing some effective tools in evolutionary multiobjective optimization.

In particular, to complement the behavior of the CA and provide as much diversified information as possible, the DA aims at exploring areas under-exploited by the CA including the infeasible regions. To leverage the complementary effects of both archives, we develop a restricted mating selection mechanism that adaptively chooses appropriate mating parents from them according to their evolution status.

Being based on the CMA-ES, the recently proposed matrix adaptation evolution strategy (MA-ES) establishes the rather surprising result that the covariance matrix and all associated operations (e.g., potentially unstable eigen decomposition) can be replaced by an iteratively updated transformation matrix without any loss of performance. In order to further simplify MAES and reduce its O(n2) time and storage complexity to O(mn) with m ≪ n such as m ∈ O(1) or m∈O(log(n)), we present the limited-memory MA-ES for efficient zeroth order large-scale optimization. The algorithm demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a set of established large-scale benchmarks.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2855049","Austrian Science Fund(grant numbers:P29651-N32); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8410043","Evolutionary computation;optimization","Covariance matrices;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Time complexity;Gradient methods;Stochastic processes","computational complexity;covariance matrices;evolutionary computation;gradient methods;optimisation;stochastic processes","time complexity;large-scale black-box optimization;matrix adaptation evolution strategy;covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy;limited-memory matrix adaptation;limited-memory MA-ES;iteratively updated transformation matrix;potentially unstable eigen decomposition;stochastic optimization problems;nonconvex optimization problems;CMA-ES","","27","","32","IEEE","11 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
