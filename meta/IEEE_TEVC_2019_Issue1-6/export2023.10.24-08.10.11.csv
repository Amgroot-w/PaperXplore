However, existing learning-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) spend too much computational overhead on learning. To address this problem, we propose a learning-based MOEA where an online learning algorithm is embedded within the evolutionary search procedure. The online learning algorithm takes the stream of sequentially generated solutions along the evolution as its training data. It is noted that the stream of solutions are temporal, dependent, nonstationary, and nonstatic. These data characteristics make existing online learning algorithm not suitable for the evolution data. We hence modify an existing online agglomerative clustering algorithm to accommodate these characteristics. The modified online clustering algorithm is applied to adaptively discover the structure of the Pareto optimal set; and the learned structure is used to guide new solution creation.

To fill this gap and facilitate possible systematic studies, we introduce a new test problem generator. The proposed generator enables the design of test problems with controllable difficulties regarding the feature of DtA PF boundaries. Three representative MOEAs, NSGA-II, SMS-EMOA, and MOEA/D-DRA, are performed on a series of test problems created using the proposed generator. Experimental results indicate that all the three algorithms perform poorly on the new test problems. Meanwhile, a modified variant of MOEA/D-DRA, denoted as MOEA/D-DRA-UT, is validated to be more effective in dealing with these problems.

This paper proposes a many-objective optimization algorithm with two interacting processes: cascade clustering and reference point incremental learning (CLIA). In the population selection process based on cascade clustering (CC), using the reference vectors provided by the process based on incremental learning, the nondominated and the dominated individuals are clustered and sorted with different manners in a cascade style and are selected by round-robin for better proximity and diversity. In the reference vector adaptation process based on reference point incremental learning, using the feedbacks from the process based on CC, proper distribution of reference points is gradually obtained by incremental learning. Experimental studies on several benchmark problems show that CLIA is competitive compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms and has impressive efficiency and versatility using only the interactions between the two processes without incurring extra evaluations.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2874465","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572104,61751203,51579040); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8485382","Clustering;incremental machine learning;interacting processes;many-objective optimization;reference vector","Sociology;Statistics;Optimization;Clustering algorithms;Evolutionary computation;Sun;Complexity theory","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);Pareto optimisation;pattern clustering;sorting;vectors","many-objective evolutionary algorithm;interacting processes;reference vector-based algorithms;many-objective optimization algorithm;cascade clustering;population selection process;reference vector adaptation process;reference point incremental learning;round-robin selection;Pareto front","","46","","57","IEEE","8 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the one hand, with a limited population size, it is difficult for an algorithm to cover different parts of the whole Pareto front (PF) in a large objective space. The algorithm tends to concentrate only on limited areas. On the other hand, as the number of objectives increases, solutions easily have poor values on some objectives, which can be regarded as poor bottleneck objectives that restrict solutions' convergence to the PF. Thus, we propose a coevolutionary particle swarm optimization with a bottleneck objective learning (BOL) strategy for many-objective optimization. In the proposed algorithm, multiple swarms coevolve in distributed fashion to maintain diversity for approximating different parts of the whole PF, and a novel BOL strategy is developed to improve convergence on all objectives. In addition, we develop a solution reproduction procedure with both an elitist learning strategy (ELS) and a juncture learning strategy (JLS) to improve the quality of archived solutions. The ELS helps the algorithm to jump out of local PFs, and the JLS helps to reach out to the missing areas of the PF that are easily missed by the swarms. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using two widely used test suites with different numbers of objectives. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm compares favorably with six other state-of-the-art algorithms on many-objective optimization.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2875430","Outstanding Youth Science Foundation(grant numbers:61822602); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772207,61332002); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2014A030306038); Project for Pearl River New Star in Science and Technology(grant numbers:201506010047); GDUPS in 2016; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489938","Bottleneck objective learning (BOL);coevolution;many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs);particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Sociology;Convergence;Particle swarm optimization;Pareto optimization;Approximation algorithms","evolutionary computation;particle swarm optimisation","coevolutionary particle swarm optimization;bottleneck objective learning strategy;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;many-objective optimization problems;elitist learning strategy;juncture learning strategy;BOL strategy","","180","","56","OAPA","11 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inspired by the notion of surprise as an effective driver of divergent search and its orthogonal nature to novelty this paper investigates the impact of the former to QD performance. For that purpose we introduce three new QD algorithms which employ surprise as a diversity measure, either on its own or combined with novelty, and compare their performance against novelty search with local competition, the state of the art QD algorithm. The algorithms are tested in a robot navigation task across 60 highly deceptive mazes.

In some common AUV missions, e.g., wreckage search for rescue, an AUV is often required to traverse multiple targets in a complex environment with dense obstacles. In such case, the AUV path planning problem becomes even more challenging. In order to address the problem, this paper develops a two-layer algorithm, namely ACO-A*, by combining the ant colony optimization (ACO) with the A* search. Once a mission with a set of arbitrary targets is assigned, ACO is responsible to determine the traveling order of targets. But, prior to ACO, a cost graph indicating the necessary traveling costs among targets must be quickly established to facilitate traveling order evaluation. For this purpose, a coarse-grained modeling with a representative-based estimation (RBE) strategy is proposed. Following the order obtained by ACO, targets will be traversed one by one and the pairwise path planning to reach each target can be performed during vehicle driving. To deal with the dense obstacles, A* is adopted to plan paths based on a fine-grained modeling and an admissible heuristic function is designed for A* to guarantee its optimality. Experiments on both synthetic and realistic scenarios have been designed to validate the efficiency of the proposed ACO-A*, as well as the effectiveness of RBE and the necessity of A*.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2878221","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61622206,61332002,61873097); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2015A030306024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8510897","A* search;ant colony optimization (ACO);autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs);dense obstacles;path planning","Path planning;Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Three-dimensional displays;Optimization;Collision avoidance","ant colony optimisation;autonomous underwater vehicles;collision avoidance;graph theory;mobile robots;path planning;search problems","complex environment;dense obstacles;AUV path planning problem;arbitrary targets;cost graph;necessary traveling costs;traveling order evaluation;coarse-grained modeling;representative-based estimation strategy;pairwise path;autonomous underwater vehicles;wreckage search;multiple targets;ACO-A*;ant colony optimization plus A*;3D traveling","","70","","48","OAPA","26 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the purpose of reducing the possibility of getting trapped in the local optima and also expanding the search space, randomly occurring time-delays that reflect the history of previous personal best and global best particles are introduced in the velocity updating model in a distributed manner. Eight well-known benchmark functions are employed to evaluate the proposed RODDPSO algorithm which is shown via extensive comparisons to outperform some currently popular PSO algorithms.

Competition is designed by adaptively running different evolutionary operators on multiple populations. The operator that better fits the problem’s characteristics will receive more computational resources, being rewarded by a decomposition-based credit assignment strategy. Cooperation is achieved by a cooperative selection of the offspring generated by different populations. In this way, the promising offspring from one population have chances to migrate into the other populations to enhance their convergence or diversity. Moreover, the population update information is further exploited to build an evolutionary potentiality model, which is used to guide the evolutionary process.

Then, a general framework using two archives, i.e., the convergence and the diversity archives, is adopted to cooperatively solve these problems. Moreover, the diversity archive simultaneously employs a clustering strategy to guarantee diversity in the objective space and a niche-based clearing strategy to promote the same in the decision space. At the end of evolution process, solutions in the convergence and the diversity archives are recombined to obtain a large number of multiple Pareto optimal solutions.

BSCA consists of three layers. The first layer is composed of multiple subpopulations evolving cooperatively to obtain diverse Pareto fronts. Based on the solutions obtained by the first layer, the second layer aims to further increase the diversity of solutions. The third layer refines the solutions found in the second layer by adopting an adaptive gradient refinement search strategy and a dynamic optimization method to cope with changing concurrent multiple service requests, thereby effectively improving the accuracy of solutions. Experiments on agricultural IoT services in the presence of dynamic requests under different distributions are performed based on two service-providing strategies, i.e., single service and collaborative service.

Recent practice has focused on the fully connected topology (Gbest) despite earlier indications on the superiority of local particle neighborhoods. This paper seeks to address the controversy with empirical trials with canonical PSO on a large benchmark of functions, categorized into 14 properties. This paper confirms the early lore that Gbest is the overall better algorithm for unimodal and separable problems and that a ring neighborhood of connectivity two (Lbest) is the preferred choice for multimodal, nonseparable and composition functions. Topologies of intermediate particle connectivity were also tested and the difference in global/local performance was found to be even more marked. A measure of significant improvement is introduced in order to distinguish major improvements from refinements. Lbest, according to the experiments on the 84 test functions and a bi-modal problem of adjustable severity, is found to have significant improvements later in the run, and to be more diverse at termination. A mobility study shows that Lbest is better able to jump between optimum basins. Indeed Gbest was unable to switch basins in the bi-modal trial. The implication is that Lbest's larger terminal diversity, its better ability to basin hop and its later significant improvement account for the performance enhancement. In several cases where Lbest was not the better algorithm, the trials show that Lbest was not stuck but would have continued to improve with an extended evaluation budget. Canonical PSO is a baseline algorithm and the ancestor of all contemporary PSO variants. These variants build on the basic structure of baseline PSO and the broad conclusions of this paper are expected to follow through. In particular, research that fails to consider local topologies risks underplaying the success of the promoted algorithm.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2880894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531770","Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Topology;Sociology;Statistics;Particle swarm optimization;Network topology;Benchmark testing;Standards","particle swarm optimisation;topology","canonical PSO;baseline PSO;particle swarm optimization;interparticle communication topology;fully connected topology;Gbest;local particle neighborhoods;ring neighborhood;multimodal composition functions;nonseparable composition functions;intermediate particle connectivity;bi-modal trial;Lbest","","64","","44","IEEE","11 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this difficulty, this paper proposes an SRM-driven GP approach, which uses an experimental method (instead of theoretical estimation) to measure the VC dimension of a mixture of linear and nonlinear regression models for the first time. The experimental method has been conducted using uniform and nonuniform settings. The results show that our method has impressive generalization gains over standard GP and GP with the 0.632 bootstrap, and that the proposed method using the nonuniform setting has further improvement than its counterpart using the uniform setting. Further analyzes reveal that the proposed method can evolve more compact models, and that the behavioral difference between these compact models and the target models is much smaller than their counterparts evolved by the other GP methods.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2881392","Marsden Fund(grant numbers:VUW1509,VUW1615); Huawei Industry Fund(grant numbers:E2880/3663); Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:209862/3580,213150/3662); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8536418","Generalization;genetic programming (GP);structural risk minimization (SRM);symbolic regression;Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) dimension","Training;Complexity theory;Genetic programming;Data models;Estimation;Minimization;Computational modeling","estimation theory;generalisation (artificial intelligence);genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;regression analysis","Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension;SRM-driven GP approach;VC dimension;nonlinear regression models;structural risk minimization-driven genetic programming;symbolic regression;generalization ability;evolutionary process;generalization gains","","23","","49","IEEE","15 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes an adaptive LS starting strategy by utilizing our proposed quasi-entropy index to address its key issue, i.e., when to start LS. The changes of the index as the optimization proceeds are analyzed in theory and via numerical tests. The proposed algorithm is tested on multimodal benchmark functions. Parameter sensitivity analysis is performed to demonstrate its robustness. The comparison results reveal overall higher convergence rate and accuracy than those of CLPSO, state-of-the-art particle swarm optimization variants.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2885075","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571336,71372202,71672137); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8561256","Adaptive strategy;evolutionary algorithm;local search (LS);multimodal function;particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Convergence;Optimization;Particle swarm optimization;Sociology;Statistics;Indexes;Standards","convergence;entropy;particle swarm optimisation;search problems","higher convergence rate;comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization algorithm;local search;multimodal functions;comprehensive learning particle swarm optimizer;quasientropy index;parameter sensitivity analysis","","259","","51","IEEE","5 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
