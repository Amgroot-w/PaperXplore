Fruitful insurance products are launched by insurers, but there is little research on how to make a proper insurance investment plan for a specific policyholder given different kinds of policies. In this paper, we aim to propose a practical approach to multipolicy insurance investment planning with a data-driven model and an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA). First, by making use of the insurance data accumulated in the modern financial market, an optimization model about how to choose endowment and hospitalization policies is built to maximize the yearly profit of insurance investment. With the model parameters set according to the real data from insurance market, the resulting plan is practical and individualized. Second, as the optimal solution cannot be achieved by mathematical deduction under this data-driven model, an EDA is introduced. To adapt the EDA for the considered problem, the proposed EDA is mixed with both the continuous and discrete probability distribution models to handle different kinds of variables. In addition, an adaptive scheme for choosing suitable distribution models and an efficient constraint handling strategy are proposed. Experiments under different conditions confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and method.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2017.2782571","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61332002,61622206,61772569); Hong Kong RGC General Research Fund(grant numbers:9042038 (CityU 11205314)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8187672","Data-driven;endowment insurance;estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA);hospitalization insurances;mixed-variable optimization","Insurance;Investment;Mathematical model;Biological system modeling;Adaptation models;Optimization;Estimation","insurance;investment;optimisation;statistical distributions;stock markets","EDA;insurance data;optimization model;insurance market;data-driven model;multipolicy insurance investment planning;insurers;probability distribution models;estimation of distribution algorithm;insurance products;insurance investment plan","","36","","51","OAPA","12 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, there exists knowledge from distinct (but possibly related) design exercises, which have either been previously completed or are currently in-progress, that may be leveraged to enhance the optimization performance of a particular target optimization task of interest. Further, it is observed that modern day design cycles are typically distributed in nature, and consist of multiple teams working on associated ideas in tandem. In such environments, vast amounts of related information can become available at various stages of the search process corresponding to some ongoing target optimization exercise. Successfully exploiting this knowledge is expected to be of significant value in many practical settings, where solving an optimization problem from scratch may be exorbitantly costly or time consuming. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose an adaptive knowledge reuse framework for surrogate-assisted multiobjective optimization of computationally expensive problems, based on the novel idea of multiproblem surrogates. This idea provides the capability to acquire and spontaneously transfer learned models across problems, facilitating efficient global optimization. The efficacy of our proposition is demonstrated on a series of synthetic benchmark functions, as well as two practical case studies.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2017.2783441","National Research Foundation Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8207638","Efficient global optimization (EGO);knowledge transfer;multiobjective optimization;multiproblem surrogates (MPSs)","Optimization;Knowledge transfer;Computational modeling;Search problems;Evolutionary computation;Gaussian processes","evolutionary computation;optimisation","adaptive knowledge reuse framework;surrogate-assisted multiobjective optimization;computationally expensive problems;multiproblem surrogates;transfer evolutionary multiobjective optimization;optimization problem","","76","","60","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To fill this gap, we develop a novel reproduction operator based on the differential evolution. The main idea is using the evolution paths to depict the population movement and predict its tendency. These evolution paths are used to create potential solutions, and thus, accelerate the convergence toward the PS. Furthermore, a self-adaptive mechanism is introduced to adapt related parameters automatically. This operator is implemented in two well-known many-objective evolutionary algorithm frameworks.

To alleviate the difficulty, this paper presents a multitasking evolutionary optimization framework for solving computationally expensive problems. In the framework, knowledge is transferred from a number of computationally cheap optimization problems to help the solution of the expensive problem on the basis of the recently proposed multifactorial EA (MFEA), leading to a faster convergence of the expensive problem. However, existing MFEAs do not work well in solving multitasking problems whose optimums do not lie in the same location or when the dimensions of the decision space are not the same. To address the above issues, the existing MFEA is generalized by proposing two strategies, one for decision variable translation and the other for decision variable shuffling, to facilitate knowledge transfer between optimization problems having different locations of the optimums and different numbers of decision variables. To assess the effectiveness of the generalized MFEA (G-MFEA), empirical studies have been conducted on eight multitasking instances and eight test problems for expensive optimization. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed G-MFEA works more efficiently for multitasking optimization and successfully accelerates the convergence of expensive optimization problems compared to single-task optimization.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2017.2785351","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61525302,61590922,61621004); Projects of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:2014020021,LR2015021); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:N160801001,N161608001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231172","Evolutionary algorithms (EAs);evolutionary multitasking optimization;expensive optimization;knowledge transfer","Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Sociology;Statistics;Convergence;Knowledge transfer","evolutionary computation;optimisation","single-task optimization;conventional evolutionary algorithms;expensive optimization problems;multitasking evolutionary optimization framework;computationally expensive problems;computationally cheap optimization problems;decision variable translation;generalized MFEA;multifactorial EA;decision variable shuffling","","148","","39","IEEE","20 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, once implemented, their application to a new problem domain or a slight change in the problem description would often require additional expert intervention. There is a growing number of studies on reusable cross-domain search methodologies, such as selection hyper-heuristics, which are applicable to problem instances from various domains, requiring minimal expert intervention or even none. This paper introduces a new learning automata-based selection hyper-heuristic controlling a set of multiobjective metaheuristics. The approach operates above three well-known multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and mixes them, exploiting the strengths of each algorithm. The performance and behavior of two variants of the proposed selection hyper-heuristic, each utilizing a different initialization scheme are investigated across a range of unconstrained multiobjective mathematical benchmark functions from two different sets and the real-world problem of vehicle crashworthiness. The empirical results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach for cross-domain search, regardless of the initialization scheme, on those problems when compared to each individual multiobjective algorithm. Moreover, both variants perform significantly better than some previously proposed selection hyper-heuristics for multiobjective optimization, thus significantly enhancing the opportunities for improved multiobjective optimization.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2017.2785346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8231198","Evolutionary algorithms;hyper-heuristics;multiobjective optimization;online learning;operational research","Optimization;Learning automata;Search problems;Evolutionary computation;Benchmark testing;Sociology;Statistics","evolutionary computation;learning automata;optimisation;search problems","learning automata-based multiobjective hyper-heuristic;computationally hard optimization problems;reusable cross-domain search methodologies;problem instances;minimal expert intervention;learning automata-based selection hyper-heuristic;multiobjective metaheuristics;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;unconstrained multiobjective mathematical benchmark functions;real-world problem;individual multiobjective algorithm;improved multiobjective optimization;expert intervention","","43","","76","IEEE","20 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A meaningful representation gives rise to significant performance improvement of associated machine learning (ML) tasks by replacing the raw data as the input. However, optimal architecture design and model parameter estimation in DL algorithms are widely considered to be intractable. Evolutionary algorithms are much preferable for complex and nonconvex problems due to its inherent characteristics of gradient-free and insensitivity to the local optimal. In this paper, we propose a computationally economical algorithm for evolving unsupervised deep neural networks to efficiently learn meaningful representations, which is very suitable in the current big data era where sufficient labeled data for training is often expensive to acquire. In the proposed algorithm, finding an appropriate architecture and the initialized parameter values for an ML task at hand is modeled by one computational efficient gene encoding approach, which is employed to effectively model the task with a large number of parameters. In addition, a local search strategy is incorporated to facilitate the exploitation search for further improving the performance. Furthermore, a small proportion labeled data is utilized during evolution search to guarantee the learned representations to be meaningful. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been thoroughly investigated over classification tasks. Specifically, error classification rate on MNIST with 1.15% is reached by the proposed algorithm consistently, which is considered a very promising result against state-of-the-art unsupervised DL algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2808689","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201506240048); Miaozi Project in Science and Technology Innovation Program of Sichuan Province, China(grant numbers:16-YCG061); National Natural Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholar(grant numbers:61622504); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61432012,U1435213); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8300639","Deep learning (DL);evolutionary algorithm (EA);evolving neural networks;neural networks;representation learning","Artificial neural networks;Training;Task analysis;Evolutionary computation;Computer architecture;Computational modeling","Big Data;evolutionary computation;neural nets;pattern classification;search problems;unsupervised learning","evolving unsupervised deep neural networks;deep learning;model parameter estimation;evolutionary algorithms;sufficient labeled data;ML task;proportion labeled data;learned representations;machine learning tasks;Big Data era;unsupervised DL algorithms;gene encoding approach;error classification rate","","99","","68","IEEE","22 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To handle such problems, a metamodel is first formed from a few exact (high-fidelity) solution evaluations and then optimized by an algorithm in a progressive manner. However, in solving multiobjective or many-objective optimization problems involving multiple constraints, a simple extension of the idea to form one metamodel for each objective and constraint function may not constitute the most efficient approach. The cumulative effect of errors from each metamodel may turn out to be detrimental for the accuracy of the overall optimization procedure. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy of different plausible metamodeling frameworks for multiobjective and many-objective optimization and provide a comparative study by discussing advantages and disadvantages of each framework. The results presented in this paper are obtained using the well-known Kriging metamodeling approach. Based on our extensive simulation studies on proposed frameworks, we report intriguing observations about the behavior of each framework, which may provide salient guidelines for further studies in this emerging area within evolutionary multiobjective optimization.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2018.2828091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8340780","Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO);Kriging;metamodel;surrogate model;taxonomy","Metamodeling;Optimization;Taxonomy;Linear programming;Computational modeling;Complexity theory;Clustering algorithms","evolutionary computation;optimisation;statistical analysis","many-objective optimization problems;constraint function;evolutionary multiobjective optimization;computationally expensive procedures;plausible metamodeling frameworks;Kriging metamodeling approach","","50","","30","IEEE","18 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given a set of exemplary states of normal operation of a business process, GOCCS synthesizes constraints in linear programming or nonlinear programming form. The synthesized constraints can be then paired with an arbitrary objective function and supplied to an off-the-shelf solver to find optimal parameters of the process.
