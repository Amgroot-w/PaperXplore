However, accompanied with the generative tasks becoming more and more challenging, existing GANs (GAN and its variants) tend to suffer from different training problems such as instability and mode collapse. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN framework called evolutionary GANs (E-GANs) for stable GAN training and improved generative performance. Unlike existing GANs, which employ a predefined adversarial objective function alternately training a generator and a discriminator, we evolve a population of generators to play the adversarial game with the discriminator. Different adversarial training objectives are employed as mutation operations and each individual (i.e., generator candidature) are updated based on these mutations. Then, we devise an evaluation mechanism to measure the quality and diversity of generated samples, such that only well-performing generator(s) are preserved and used for further training. In this way, E-GAN overcomes the limitations of an individual adversarial training objective and always preserves the well-performing offspring, contributing to progress in, and the success of GANs. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that E-GAN achieves convincing generative performance and reduces the training problems inherent in existing GANs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2895748","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:FL-170100117,DP-180103424,IH180100002,DE180101438); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFC0804003); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/J017515/1,EP/P005578/1); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); Shenzhen Peacock Plan(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission(grant numbers:ZDSYS201703031748284); Program for University Key Laboratory of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017KSYS008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8627945","Deep generative models;evolutionary computation;generative adversarial networks (GANs)","Gallium nitride;Training;Generators;Generative adversarial networks;Evolutionary computation;Task analysis;Computational modeling","data handling;evolutionary computation;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture","predefined adversarial objective function;adversarial game;generator candidature;E-GAN;generative performance;evolutionary generative adversarial networks;generative models;generative tasks;evolutionary GANs;stable GAN training;adversarial training objectives","","172","","77","IEEE","27 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The framework encounters difficulties on nonseparable problems, where variables interact with each other. Using the static grouping methods, variables will be theoretically grouped into one big subcomponent, whereas the random grouping strategy endures low efficiency. In this paper, a dynamic CC framework is proposed to tackle the challenge. The proposed framework works in a computationally efficient manner, in which the computational resources are allocated to a series of elitist subcomponents consisting of superior variables. First, a novel estimation method is proposed to evaluate the contribution of variables using the historical information of the best overall fitness. Based on the contribution and the interaction information, a dynamic grouping strategy is conducted to construct the dynamic subcomponent that evolves in the next evolutionary period. The constructed subcomponents are different from each other, and therefore the required parameters to control the optimization of each subcomponent vary a lot in each evolutionary period. A stage-by-stage parameter adaptation strategy is proposed to adapt the optimizer to the dynamic optimization environment.

The main idea is to track the Pareto optimal set (PS) directly via problem reformulation. To begin with, the algorithm obtains a set of reference directions in the decision space and associates them with a set of weight variables for locating the PS. Afterwards, the original large-scale multiobjective optimization problem is reformulated into a low-dimensional single-objective optimization problem. In the reformulated problem, the decision space is reconstructed by the weight variables and the objective space is reduced by an indicator function. Thanks to the low dimensionality of the weight variables and reduced objective space, a set of quasi-optimal solutions can be obtained efficiently. Finally, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is used to spread the quasi-optimal solutions over the approximate Pareto optimal front evenly. Experiments have been conducted on a variety of large-scale multiobjective problems with up to 5000 decision variables. Four different types of representative algorithms are embedded into the proposed framework and compared with their original versions, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been compared with two state-of-the-art algorithms for large-scale multiobjective optimization.

Current techniques use a multilevel approach wherein an initial partitioning is performed after compressing the hypergraph to a predetermined level. This level is typically chosen to produce very coarse hypergraphs in which heuristic algorithms are fast and effective. This paper presents a novel memetic algorithm which remains effective on larger initial hypergraphs. This enables the exploitation of information that can be lost during coarsening and results in improved final solution quality. We use this algorithm to present an empirical analysis of the space of possible initial hypergraphs in terms of its searchability at different levels of coarsening. We find that the best results arise at coarsening levels unique to each hypergraph. Based on this, we introduce an adaptive scheme that stops coarsening when the rate of information loss in a hypergraph becomes nonlinear and show that this produces further improvements. The results show that we have identified a valuable role for evolutionary algorithms within the current state-of-the-art HGP framework.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2896951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8633939","Evolutionary algorithms (EAs);hypergraph partitioning (HGP);memetic algorithms;multilevel algorithms","Partitioning algorithms;Memetics;Very large scale integration;Optimization;Frequency modulation;Computer science;Heuristic algorithms","computational complexity;evolutionary computation;graph theory;optimisation;search problems","information loss;empirical analysis;HGP framework;adaptive coarsening;evolutionary n -level hypergraph partitioning;evolutionary algorithms;adaptive scheme;coarsening levels;novel memetic algorithm;heuristic algorithms;coarse hypergraphs;predetermined level;initial partitioning;multilevel approach;computationally tractable subproblems;computer science applications;NP-hard problem;NP","","7","","45","CCBY","3 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Generally, the effectiveness of an algorithm for CMOPs is evaluated by artificial test problems. However, after a brief review of current artificial test problems, we have found that they are not well-designed and fail to reflect the characteristics of real-world applications (e.g., small feasibility ratio). Thus, in this paper, we first propose a new constraint construction method to facilitate the systematic design of test problems. Then, on the basis of this method, we design a new test suite consisting of 14 instances, which covers diverse characteristics extracted from real-world CMOPs and can be divided into four types. Considering that the comprehensive performance comparisons among the constraint-handling techniques (CHTs) remain scarce, we choose several representative CHTs and compare their performance on our test suite. The performance comparisons identify the strengths and weaknesses of different CHTs on different types of CMOPs and provide guidelines on how to select/design a CHT in a specific scenario.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2896967","Central South University(grant numbers:2018CX010); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61673397); Hunan Provincial Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:2016JJ1018); Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Intelligent Robots and Systems, Beijing Institute of Technology(grant numbers:2018IRS06); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8632683","Constrained multiobjective optimization;constraint-handling techniques (CHTs);evolutionary algorithms (EAs);performance comparisons;test suite","Pareto optimization;Geometry;Convergence;Evolutionary computation;Systematics;Indexes","constraint handling;evolutionary computation;optimisation;program testing","evolutionary computation;CMOP;constraint-handling techniques;evolutionary constrained multiobjective optimization;test suite construction;artificial test problems","","137","","52","IEEE","1 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So far, some research efforts have been done on the use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for solving single objective variable-length optimization problems. In fact, the variable-length problem difficulty can also exist in multiobjective optimization. However, such challenging problems have not yet gained much attention in the area of evolutionary multiobjective optimization. To facilitate the research on the variable-length Pareto optimization, we first suggest a systematic toolkit for constructing benchmark multiobjective test problems with variable-length feature in this paper. Then, we also propose a variable-length multiobjective EA based on a two-level decomposition strategy, which decomposes a multiobjective optimization problem in terms of the penalty boundary intersection search directions and the dimensionality of variables. The performance of our proposed algorithm and the other three state-of-the-art algorithms on these problems are compared.

Typically, surrogate-assisted methods have been used in the literature to tackle computationally expensive problems, but such studies have largely focused on problems with 1-3 objectives. In this paper, we present an approach called hybrid surrogate-assisted many-objective evolutionary algorithm to solve computationally expensive MaOPs. The key features of the approach include: 1) the use of multiple surrogates to effectively approximate a wide range of objective functions; 2) use of two sets of reference vectors for improved performance on irregular Pareto fronts (PFs); 3) effective use of archive solutions during offspring generation; and 4) a local improvement scheme for generating high quality infill solutions. Furthermore, the approach includes constraint handling which is often overlooked in contemporary algorithms. The performance of the approach is benchmarked extensively on a set of unconstrained and constrained problems with regular and irregular PFs. A statistical comparison with the existing techniques highlights the efficacy and potential of the approach.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2899030","Natural Environment Research Council(grant numbers:NE/P017436/1); Australian Government via “Research Training Program Scholarship”; University of Jyvaskyla (funding of Prof. K.

LSC has numerous applications and is, however, NP-complete. In this paper, we investigate an approach for solving LSC by converting an LSC instance to a domain-constrained Latin square graph and then solving the associated list coloring problem. To be effective, we first employ a constraint propagation-based kernelization technique to reduce the graph model and then call for a dedicated memetic algorithm to find a legal list coloring. The population-based memetic algorithm combines a problem-specific crossover operator to generate meaningful offspring solutions, an iterated tabu search procedure to improve the offspring solutions, and a distance-quality-based pool updating strategy to maintain a healthy diversity of the population. Extensive experiments on more than 1800 LSC benchmark instances in the literature show that the proposed approach can successfully solve all the instances, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods. To our knowledge, this is the first approach achieving such a performance for the considered problem.
