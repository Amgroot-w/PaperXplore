However, there has been few literature on the systematic review of the related studies currently. This article provides a comprehensive survey for evolutionary constrained multiobjective optimization. We first review a large number of CMOEAs through categorization and analyze their advantages and drawbacks in each category.

Relevant symmetry properties are identified through the alternating group of the original solution space or the corresponding coordinate rotation space. Then, a memetic algorithm is proposed to explore promising search regions regarding the reduced solution space. The memetic algorithm employs a problem-specific crossover operator guided by  ${k}$ -medoids clustering technique to produce meaningful offspring solutions. The algorithm additionally uses a simulated annealing procedure to intensively exploit a given search region and a distance-and-quality-based population management strategy to ensure a reasonable diversity of the population. Experimental results on commonly used benchmark instances and newly introduced large-scale instances with sizes up to 2000 facilities show that the proposed algorithm competes favorably with state-of-the-art SRFLP algorithms.

To tackle the issue, in this article, a variable granularity search-based multiobjective EA, termed as VGS-MOEA, is proposed for high-dimensional FS, where one bit in the individual representation denotes a group of features and results in the search space reducing greatly. To be specific, at the beginning, the search granularity of VGS-MOEA is coarse (a bit denotes a great number of features), which helps the proposed algorithm detect the potentially good feature subsets quickly. As the evolution continues, the search granularity is refined gradually, where a bit denotes a smaller number of features until it only represents one feature. With this decomposition of granularity, a more refined search is performed and leads to the VGS-MOEA obtaining feature subsets with higher quality. Experimental results on 12 high-dimensional data sets with different characteristics have shown that in comparison with the state of the arts, the proposed VGS-MOEA has demonstrated its superiority in terms of the classification accuracy, the number of selected features, and the running time.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3160458","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076001,61976001,61876184,U1804262); Key Projects of University Excellent Talents Support Plan of Anhui Provincial Department of Education(grant numbers:gxyqZD2021089); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:2008085QF309); Humanities and Social Sciences Project of Chinese Ministry of Education(grant numbers:18YJC870004); University Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province(grant numbers:GXXT-2020-050); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9737335","Evolutionary algorithm (EA);feature selection (FS);high-dimensional data classification;multiobjective optimization","Feature extraction;Signal processing algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Particle swarm optimization;Optimization;Genetic algorithms;Encoding","evolutionary computation;feature selection;pattern classification;search problems","EA-based FS methods;evolutionary algorithms;high-dimensional data classification;high-dimensional data sets;high-dimensional FS;refined search;search granularity;search space;variable granularity search-based multiobjective EA;variable granularity search-based multiobjective feature selection algorithm;VGS-MOEA","","8","","45","IEEE","18 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Every circuit has a certain level of inherent resilience to faults. Often times, this inherent resilience to faults is insufficient for the given application. This is because conventional synthesis tools generally only focus on optimizing a circuit with respect to area, power, or timing budgets. There is a wide range of applications where faulty circuit behavior can lead to fatal results. Fault injection analyses are reported and show that even a single fault can be critical to the desired circuit operation. To which end, this article presents synthesis of fault-resilient (SYFR) circuits, an evolutionary method for automated synthesis of increased fault-resilience digital circuits suitable for fine-grained use. Test results for synthesis of up to 60 input circuits with SYFR are reported. SYFR can be repeatedly applied to a circuit to obtain various design tradeoffs between fault resilience and implementation costs. SYFR can also be flexibly applied to build circuits, which are selectively fault resilient, i.e., their tolerance to faults is workload aware. In addition, a novel population seeding mechanism to reduce the design space is introduced and experimentally validated. In summary, this article demonstrates that SYFR can be considered a competitive synthesis methodology for constructing fault-resilient circuits.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3169641","Chosun University(grant numbers:K949856042); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9761994","Digital image processing;digital logic synthesis;fault tolerance;metaheuristic optimization","Circuit faults;Fault tolerant systems;Redundancy;Optimization;Integrated circuit reliability;Hardware;Costs","circuit reliability;digital circuits;electronic design automation;evolutionary computation;fault tolerance;logic circuits;logic design;network synthesis;radiation hardening (electronics)","automated synthesis;evolutionary method;fault injection analyses;fault-resilient digital circuits;SYFR;upset event","","","","43","IEEE","22 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The two objectives are often conflicting, thus a multiobjective feature selection method can obtain a set of nondominated feature subsets. Each solution in the set has a different size and a corresponding classification error rate. However, most existing feature selection algorithms have ignored that, for a given size, there can be different feature subsets with very similar or the same accuracy. This article introduces a niching-based multiobjective feature selection method that simultaneously minimizes the number of selected features and the classification error rate. The proposed method conceives to identify: 1) a set of feature subsets with good convergence and distribution and 2) multiple feature subsets choosing the same number of features with almost the same lowest classification error rate. The contributions of this article are threefold. First, a niching and global interaction mutation operator is proposed that can produce promising feature subsets. Second, a newly developed environmental selection mechanism allows equal informative feature subsets to be stored by relaxing the Pareto-dominance relationship. Finally, the proposed subset repairing mechanism can generate better feature subsets and further remove the redundant features. The proposed method is compared against seven multiobjective feature selection algorithms on 19 datasets, including both binary and multiclass classification tasks. The results show that the proposed method can evolve a rich and diverse set of nondominated solutions for different feature selection tasks, and their availability helps in understanding the relationships between features.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3168052","Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1913,VUW1914); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61922072,61876169); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge (SfTI) Fund(grant numbers:E3603/2903); MBIE Data Science SSIF Fund(grant numbers:RTVU1914); MBIE Research Program(grant numbers:MBIEC11X2001); FPR(grant numbers:39186); China Scholarship Council (CSC) and Victoria University Joint Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9760707","Classification;differential evolution (DE);evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO);feature selection","Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Task analysis;Statistics;Sociology;Error analysis;Optimization","evolutionary computation;feature extraction;feature selection;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);Pareto optimisation;pattern classification","binary classification tasks;classification accuracy;corresponding classification error rate;different feature selection tasks;different feature subsets;differential evolution-based feature selection;equal informative feature subsets;existing feature selection;global interaction mutation operator;learning algorithm;lowest classification error rate;multiclass classification tasks;newly developed environmental selection mechanism;niching-based multiobjective approach;niching-based multiobjective feature selection method;nondominated feature subsets;promising feature subsets;redundant features;seven multiobjective feature selection algorithms;subset repairing mechanism","","13","","61","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The real world usually encounters different but related instances due to events, such as season change and vehicle breakdowns, and it is desirable to transfer knowledge gained from solving one instance to help solve another related one. However, the solutions found by the GP process can lack diversity, and the existing methods use the transferred knowledge mainly during initialization. Thus, they cannot sufficiently handle the change from the source to the target instance. To address this issue, we develop a novel knowledge transfer GP with an auxiliary population. In addition to the main population for the target instance, we initialize an auxiliary population using the transferred knowledge and evolve it alongside the main population. We develop a novel scheme to carefully exchange the knowledge between the two populations, and a surrogate model to evaluate the auxiliary population efficiently.

Most existing studies build surrogate models based on regression methods to predict the fitness of each solution, which depends heavily on the quality and quantity of offline data. Considering the evolution trait of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), the absolute fitness of each individual is not essential, instead, the relative strengths of individuals are adequate. This article explores an alternative way to realize DDEAs by establishing a contrastive learning model that performs binary classification to determine the pros and cons between individuals. The task of binary classification is relatively simpler than regression, and meanwhile the training data is inherently augmented to the square of the origin. The proposed contrastive learning model is implemented based on a siamese neural network to measure the differences between solutions. Further, we use the predicted pairwise relationship between individuals to construct a directed graph and propose a topological sort algorithm on the graph to obtain the ranking of the population. During the topological sort, a regression model based on local principle is used to resolve some conflicting issues. Integrating the above components, an offline DDEA named contrastive learning-based DDEA (CL-DDEA) is put forward. Experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-arts validate the powerfulness of CL-DDEA, especially on high-dimensional problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3170638","Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:2022B1515020049); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61873095); Guangdong Regional Joint Fund for Basic and Applied Research(grant numbers:2021B1515120078); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9763851","Contrastive learning model;data-driven evolutionary computation;surrogate model;topological sort","Data models;Optimization;Computational modeling;Statistics;Sociology;Iron;Predictive models","directed graphs;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis;sorting","absolute fitness;alternative surrogate;CL-DDEA;contrastive learning model;contrastive learning-based DDEA;data-driven age;DDEAs;historical data;offline data-driven evolutionary algorithms;offline data-driven evolutionary computation;offline DDEA;performs binary classification;predicted pairwise relationship;problem models;regression methods;regression model;relative strengths;surrogate models;topological sort algorithm;training data","","4","","63","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Promoting Transfer of Robot Neuro-Motion-Controllers by Many-Objective Topology and Weight Evolution","A. Salih; A.

Using the concept of transfer optimization, this study investigates the capabilities of neuro-motion-controllers, which were obtained by simultaneously solving several source problems, to adapt to target problems. In particular, the adaptation comparison is carried out between specialized controllers, which are optimal for a single source motion problem, and nonspecialized controllers that can solve several source motion problems. The compared types of controllers were simultaneously obtained by a many-objective evolution search that is tailored for the optimization of the topology and weights of neural networks. Based on the examined problems, it appears that nonspecialized solutions, which are “good enough” in all the source motion problems, show significantly better transfer capabilities as compared with solutions that were optimized for a single source motion problem. The proposed approach opens up new opportunities to develop controllers that have good enough performances in various environments while also exhibiting efficient adaptation capabilities to changes in the environments.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3172294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766401","Artificial neural networks (ANNs);decomposition approach;evolutionary computation (EC);genetic transfer;many-objective optimization;neuro-control;neuroevolution (NE);Pareto optimization;topology and weight evolution;transfer optimization","Optimization;Topology;Task analysis;Robots;Statistics;Sociology;Robot motion","evolutionary computation;mobile robots;motion control;neurocontrollers;optimisation;search problems;topology","adaptation capabilities;many-objective evolution search;many-objective topology;mobile robots;neural networks;nonspecialized controllers;robot neuro-motion-controllers;source motion problems;transfer capabilities;transfer optimization;weight evolution","","","","65","IEEE","3 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
