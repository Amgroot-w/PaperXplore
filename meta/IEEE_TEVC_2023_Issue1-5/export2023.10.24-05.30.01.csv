In the past five years, increased research efforts have been dedicated to large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs) by using a variety of search strategies, including variable grouping, variable analysis, problem transformation, dimensionality reduction, and novel recombination operators. Despite the success of these efforts in solving some general LSMOPs, there still remains a big gap between the LSMOPs that have been addressed and those encountered in real life, such as sparse, highly constrained, dynamic, and expensive LMOPs, as well as very large-scale and many-objective optimization problems that are widely seen and of paramount importance for solving scientific and engineering problems. Due to the significant practical importance of large-scale multiobjective optimization, there is a high demand for computationally efficient and effective evolutionary algorithms for solving LSMOPs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3273012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10138713","","Special issues and sections;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Dimensionality reduction;Computational efficiency;Search methods","","","","","","0","IEEE","30 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although a variety of methods have been proposed to solve MaOPs, with the increasing number of decision variables or objective functions, the performance of these algorithms deteriorates appreciably. In view of this, this article proposes a method to solve large-scale MaOPs (LSMaOPs) based on dimension reduction and a solving knowledge-guided evolutionary algorithm (KGEA). First, a dimension reduction method of objective functions is proposed. By clustering and aggregating the objective functions based on their correlation, the dimension of the original LSMaOP is effectively reduced. In addition, the correlations between the reduced objective functions are relatively low, so they can better represent different preferences. Then, we propose a solving KGEA to solve the transformed LSMaOP. In order to get a better set of initial solutions, a population initialization method by mirror partitioning the decision space is given, in which we dynamically modify the sampling probability according to the performance of solutions contained in each subdomain. At the same time, the algorithm will continuously supplement new excellent individuals using the solving knowledge obtained in the evolution of the population. To examine the performance of the proposed method, we carried out a number of comparative experiments.

Reducing the search range of the decision space will significantly alleviate this puzzle. With this in mind, this article proposes a fuzzy decision variables framework for large-scale multiobjective optimization. The framework divides the entire evolutionary process into two main stages: 1) fuzzy evolution and 2) precise evolution. In fuzzy evolution, we blur the decision variables of the original solution to reduce the search range of the evolutionary algorithm in the decision space so that the evolutionary population can quickly converge. The degree of fuzzification gradually decreases with the evolutionary process. Once the population approximately converges, the framework will turn to precise evolution. In precise evolution, the actual decision variables of the solution are directly optimized to increase the diversity of the population so as to be closer to the true Pareto optimal front. Finally, this article embeds some representative algorithms into the proposed framework and verifies the framework’s effectiveness through comparative experiments on various large-scale multiobjective problems with 500 to 5000 decision variables. The experimental results show that in large-scale multiobjective optimization, the framework proposed in this article can significantly improve the performance and computational efficiency of multiobjective optimization algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3118593","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876164,61772178); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2020JJ4590); Education Department Major Project of Hunan Province(grant numbers:17A212); MOEA Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Information Processing; Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2016TP1020); Provinces and Cities Joint Foundation Project(grant numbers:2017JJ4001); Hunan Province Science and Technology Project Funds(grant numbers:2018TP1036); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9563070","Decision variable;evolutionary algorithms;fuzzy evolution;large-scale optimization;multiobjective optimization","Optimization;Fuzzy sets;Pareto optimization;Convergence;Search problems;Statistics;Sociology","evolutionary computation;fuzzy set theory;Pareto optimisation;search problems","convergence search;decision space;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary process;fuzzification degree;fuzzy decision variables framework;fuzzy evolution;large-scale multiobjective optimization;multiobjective optimization algorithms;precise evolution;search range","","12","","53","IEEE","7 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Genetic programming (GP) has become a promising machine-learning approach to feature learning in image classification. The representation of existing GP-based image classification methods is usually the tree-based structure. These methods typically learn useful image features according to the output of the GP program’s root node. However, they are not flexible enough in feature learning since the features produced by internal nodes of the GP program have seldom been directly used. In this article, we propose a new image classification approach using GP with a new program structure, which can flexibly reuse features generated from different nodes, including internal nodes of the GP program. The new method can automatically learn various informative image features based on the new function set and terminal set for effective and efficient image classification. Furthermore, instead of relying on a predefined classification algorithm, the proposed approach can automatically select a suitable classification algorithm based on the learned features and conduct classification simultaneously in a single evolved GP program for an image classification task. The experimental results on 12 benchmark datasets of varying difficulty suggest that the new approach achieves better performance than many state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the flexible feature reuse in the proposed approach. The analysis of evolved GP programs/solutions shows their potentially high interpretability.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3169490","Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1913,VUW1914,VUW2115); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge (SfTI) Fund(grant numbers:E3603/2903); MBIE Data Science SSIF Fund(grant numbers:RTVU1914); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61876169); Victoria University of Wellington Ph.D. Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9761990","Feature learning;feature reuse;genetic programming (GP);image classification;program structure","Feature extraction;Task analysis;Representation learning;Training;Benchmark testing;Transforms;Support vector machines","feature extraction;genetic algorithms;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","conduct classification;effective image classification;efficient image classification;existing GP-based image classification methods;feature learning;flexible feature reuse;genetic programming;image classification approach;image classification task;informative image features;internal nodes;new program representation;predefined classification algorithm;program structure;promising machine-learning approach;single evolved GP program;suitable classification algorithm;tree-based structure;useful image features","","","","53","IEEE","22 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, current learning-based decomposition algorithms require many fitness evaluations (FEs) to detect variable interdependencies and encounter the difficulty of threshold setting. To address these issues, this study proposes an efficient adaptive differential grouping (EADG) algorithm. Instead of homogeneously tackling different types of LSBO instances, EADG first identifies the instance type by detecting the interdependencies of a few pairs of variable subsets. Only if the instance is partially separable dose EADG further engages with it by converting its decomposition process into a search process in a binary tree. This facilitates the systematic reutilization of evaluated solutions so that half the interdependencies can be directly deduced without extra FEs. To promote the decomposition accuracy, EADG specially designs a normalized interdependency indicator that can adaptively generate a decomposition threshold according to its ordinal distribution. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that EADG outperforms current popular decomposition algorithms. Further tests indicate that it can help CC achieve highly competitive optimization performance.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3170793","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61873199); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2020JM-059); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9763854","Adaptability;cooperative coevolution (CC);interdependency indicator;large-scale black-box optimization (LSBO);solution reutilization","Iron;Optimization;Sociology;Binary trees;Sun;Search problems;Roundoff errors","evolutionary computation;group theory;optimisation;search problems;trees (mathematics)","binary tree;cooperative coevolution;decomposition algorithms;EADG;efficient adaptive differential grouping algorithm;fitness evaluations;large-scale black-box optimization;learning-based decomposition algorithms;LSBO;normalized interdependency indicator;search process;variable interdependencies","","4","","51","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the computational complexity of this problem, evolutionary computation (EC) techniques have been employed to efficiently find composite services with near-optimal functional quality (i.e., quality of semantic matchmaking, QoSM for short) or nonfunctional quality (i.e., QoS) for each composition request individually. With a rapid increase in composition requests from a growing number of users, solving one composition request at a time can hardly meet the efficiency target anymore. Driven by the idea that the solutions obtained from solving one request can be highly useful for tackling other related requests, multitasking service composition approaches have been proposed to efficiently deal with multiple composition requests concurrently. However, existing attempts have not been effective in learning and sharing knowledge among solutions for multiple requests. In this article, we model the problem of collectively handling multiple service composition requests as a new multitasking service composition problem and propose a new permutation-based multifactorial evolutionary algorithm based on an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), named PMFEA-EDA, to effectively and efficiently solve this problem. In particular, we introduce a novel method for effective knowledge sharing across different service composition requests. For that, we develop a new sampling mechanism to increase the chance of identifying high-quality service compositions in both the single-tasking and multitasking contexts. Our experiment shows that our proposed approach, PMFEA-EDA, takes much less time than existing approaches that process each service request separately, and also outperforms them in terms of both QoSM and QoS.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3170899","New Zealand Marsden Fund administrated by the Royal Society of New Zealand(grant numbers:VUW1510); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9765521","Combinatorial optimization;estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA);evolutionary multitasking;quality of services (QoS) optimization;Web service composition","Semantic Web;Learning systems;Web services;Heuristic algorithms;Semantics;Estimation;Quality of service","computational complexity;distributed algorithms;evolutionary computation;quality of service;semantic Web;Web services","achieve multitasking semantic Web service composition;composite services;composition request;different service composition requests;distribution algorithm;high-quality service compositions;multiple composition requests;multiple requests;multiple service composition requests;multitasking service composition problem;near-optimal functional quality;nonfunctional quality;permutation-based multifactorial evolutionary algorithm;possible quality;QoS;related requests;service composition approaches;service request;users;Web services","","","","65","IEEE","29 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we provide a new and computationally efficient evolutionary approach allowing upper level decision makers to analyze the vagaries of lower level decision making when choosing a preferred solution with the minimum deviation from their expectations. This concept is novel and pragmatic. We demonstrate the concept through a search for optimistic–pessimistic tradeoff solutions found by an evolutionary multiobjective optimization approach first on two difficult test problems, then on a watershed management problem and a telecommunication management problem. The approach is generic and can be applied to similar hierarchical management problems to achieve minimum deviation with a more predictive and reliable outcome. The proposed solution procedure is found to choose an optimistic solution that has approximately 31%–65% reduced deviation compared to another optimistic solution chosen at random in the test problems and approximately 85%–95% reduced deviation in the two practical problems, making the method of this study applicable to practical hierarchical problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3172302","National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement(grant numbers:DBI-0939454); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766417","Bilevel optimization;decision making;evolutionary algorithms;hierarchical optimization","Optimization;Decision making;Optimized production technology;Task analysis;Systematics;Search problems;Process control","decision making;evolutionary computation","evolutionary multiobjective optimization approach;hierarchical management problems;hierarchical multiobjective problems;hierarchical subproblems;independent decision-making process;lower level decision making;multistakeholder solution;optimistic-pessimistic tradeoff solutions;telecommunication management problem;watershed management problem","","","","32","IEEE","3 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The simulations for computing high-fidelity (HF) performance estimates, such as finite element analysis or computational fluid dynamics, are typically computationally expensive. In some cases, it may also be possible to run an alternate or cheaper version of the simulation (through, e.g., use of a coarse mesh) to yield a low-fidelity (LF) performance estimate. Multifidelity optimization refers to the class of methods that aim to manage LF and HF evaluations efficiently to optimize computationally expensive problems within a limited computing budget. Among the prominent existing multifidelity approaches, some of them depend on a sufficiently dense a priori sampling; while others use unidirectional information exchange from LF to HF; both of which lead to a possibility of spending evaluation budget on unpromising search regions. This article proposes an improved multifidelity approach using an iterative, two-stage scheme (MFITS). It uses the collective information from the previously evaluated designs to determine a sampling neighborhood for LF evaluations. These samples are, in turn, used for building a co-kriging surrogate model that is then searched globally to identify a good candidate for HF evaluation. By restricting the LF sampling neighborhood, the computational budget can be used more efficiently, as the search is focused on regions that have historically produced good quality solutions. Numerical experiments and benchmarking are conducted on two suites of test problems and two practical design optimization problems to demonstrate the efficacy of MFITS.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3170970","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP190101271); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9764802","Computationally expensive optimization;multifidelity optimization","Hafnium;Computational modeling;Optimization;Numerical models;Numerical simulation;Mathematical models;Correlation","budgeting;computational fluid dynamics;design engineering;finite element analysis;Hi-Fi equipment;iterative methods;optimisation;sampling methods","co-kriging surrogate model;computational budget;computational fluid dynamics;computationally expensive problems;computing budget;engineering design optimization;evaluation budget;finite element analysis;iterative two-stage multifidelity optimization algorithm;LF sampling neighborhood;low-fidelity performance estimate;MFITS;multifidelity approach;numerical simulations;quality solutions;unidirectional information exchange","","2","","40","IEEE","28 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When a system criterion is formulated in form of a Boolean function, its BDD is constructed. Each node in the BDD is further mapped into another form to be exploited in the system analysis. However, the cost of the resultant mapping form is directly related to the BDD size which can be effectively reduced through applying proper variable reordering followed by applying reduction rules that preserve the fidelity of the BDD in correctly representing the input Boolean function. Although several algorithms have been proposed in the literature to find the optimal order of variables in the BDD, the scalability of such algorithms is a serious barrier when it comes to complex systems with exponential explosion in the possible number of orders in the search space. Furthermore, solely exploring the search space in BDD reordering is not sufficient since better permutations might be obtained with slight tuning of the candidate solutions. Thus, a sufficient degree of equilibrium between exploration and exploitation should be preserved during the evolution of the reordering algorithm. In this article, we propose a BDD optimizer driven by either genetic algorithm (GA) or swarm engines. The proposed GA-based BDD reordering optimizer iteratively processes an essentially large population with a randomized mixing of low destructive crossover/mutation operators. The proposed swarm-based optimizer, on the other hand, maps a vector of real numbers into a permutation to further construct its companion BDD. The generation of the next vector is guided by recent parameter and parameter-less swarm algorithms that are armed with effective mechanisms to simultaneously conduct exploration and exploitation. Experimental results show that our proposed optimizer effectively reduces the resultant BDD size for input Boolean functions with almost linear computational complexity. Furthermore, it has been found that exploiting recent swarm optimizers with spiral movement in BDD reordering problem can outperform GA for large scale Boolean functions. Finally, as a real-world application, our proposed algorithm is applied to reversible logic synthesis to show the achieved reduction in the quantum cost (QC) associated with BDD-based synthesis.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3170212","An-Najah National University(grant numbers:ANNU-2021-Sc0014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762787","Binary decision diagram (BDD);genetic algorithm (GA);reordering algorithm;swarm optimization","Boolean functions;Genetic algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Binary decision diagrams;Optimization;Costs;Computational complexity","binary decision diagrams;Boolean functions;computational complexity;genetic algorithms;iterative methods;optimisation;particle swarm optimisation","BDD optimizer;BDD reordering problem;BDD-based synthesis;binary decision diagrams;companion BDD;GA-based BDD;input Boolean function;optimizer reinforced;proper variable reordering;recent swarm optimizers;reordering algorithm;resultant BDD size;resultant mapping form;scale Boolean functions;search space;swarm engines;swarm-based optimizer","","4","","77","IEEE","25 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Auto-tuning is particularly useful for GPU programming, as a single kernel requires retuning after code changes, for different input data, and for different architectures. However, the discrete and nonconvex nature of the search space creates a challenging optimization problem. In this work, we investigate which algorithm produces the fastest kernels if the time-budget for the tuning task is varied. We conduct a survey by performing experiments on 26 different kernel spaces, from nine different GPUs, for 16 different evolutionary black-box optimization algorithms. We then analyze these results and introduce a novel metric based on the PageRank centrality concept as a tool for gaining insight into the difficulty of the optimization problem. We demonstrate that our metric correlates strongly with the observed tuning performance.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3210654","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(grant numbers:639.073.506); Dutch Research Council (NWO) in the framework of the NWA-ORC Call (file number NWA.1160.18.316); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905732","Auto-tuning;evolutionary computing;fitness landscape analysis;graphical processing unit (GPU) computing;performance optimization","Kernel;Graphics processing units;Optimization;Codes;Search problems;Measurement;Benchmark testing","benchmark testing;evolutionary computation;graphics processing units;optimisation;parallel processing","auto-tuning GPU kernels;automatically optimizing software;benchmarking optimization algorithms;black-box optimization algorithms;discrete nature;GPU programming;graphical processing units;input data;kernel spaces;nonconvex nature;observed tuning performance;PageRank centrality;parallel computation power;search space;single kernel;specific kernel configurations;target hardware platform;tuning task","","1","","68","IEEE","29 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, SMO establishes a sequential motion chain of two gradient-guided individuals, including a leader and a follower to enhance the effectiveness of parameter updates in each iteration. A surrogate gradient model with low computation cost is theoretically established to estimate the gradient of the follower by that of the leader through chain rule during the training process. Experimental results in terms of training quality on both fully connected multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with respect to three popular benchmark datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework in comparison with the vanilla stochastic gradient descent (SGD) implemented via backpropagation (BP) algorithm.

The optimization model, appropriate performance metrics, as well as efficient algorithms are required to further the research in this field. The algebraic description for the objective function of the optimization of the RGPO jamming strategy is difficult to obtain, and the jamming results are not deterministic under the influence of the input noise. To address these issues, this article models the generation of the RGPO jamming strategy as a stochastic simulation optimization (SSO) problem, and proposes an optimization algorithm of the RGPO jamming strategy with the help of SSO technologies. We propose the committee-based active learning (CAL) assisted optimal computing budget allocation-based particle swarm optimization (CALPSO-OCBA) to alleviate the competition between solution space search and candidate solution performance evaluation by embedding CAL into PSO-OCBA. To improve the feasibility of the proposed algorithm, a scoring scheme that does not rely on the internal knowledge of the radar tracking system (i.e., the tracking model, tracking method, and tracking parameters) is designed. In addition, we use four most widely used tracking problems as the benchmarks for testing the proposed optimization algorithm of the RGPO jamming strategy.

In view of this, dividing or clustering the sample and feature spaces at the same time, this article proposes a hybrid FS algorithm using surrogate sample-assisted particle swarm optimization (SS-PSO). First, a nonrepetitive uniform sampling strategy is employed to divide the whole sample set into several small-size sample subsets. Regarding each sample subset as a surrogate unit, next, a collaborative feature clustering mechanism is proposed to divide the feature space, with the purpose of reducing both the computational cost of clustering feature and the search space of PSO. Following that, an ensemble surrogate-assisted integer PSO is proposed. To ensure the prediction accuracy of ensemble surrogate when evaluating particles, an ensemble surrogate construction and management strategy is designed. Since the whole sample set is replaced by a small number of surrogate units, SS-PSO significantly reduces the cost of evaluating particles in PSO. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to some typical datasets, and compared with six typical evolutionary FS algorithms, as well as its several variant algorithms. The experimental results show that SS-PSO can obtain good feature subsets at the smallest computational cost on most of datasets.

Compared with other standard machine learning models such as neural networks, the models evolved by GP tend to be more interpretable due to their model structure with symbolic components. However, interpretability has not been explicitly considered in GP until recently, following the surge in the popularity of XAI. This article provides a comprehensive review of the studies on GP that can potentially improve the model interpretability, both explicitly and implicitly, as a byproduct. We group the existing studies related to explainable artificial intelligence by GP into two categories. The first category considers the intrinsic interpretability, aiming to directly evolve more interpretable (and effective) models by GP. The second category focuses on post-hoc interpretability, which uses GP to explain other black-box machine learning models, or explain the models evolved by GP by simpler models such as linear models. This comprehensive survey demonstrates the strong potential of GP for improving the interpretability of machine learning models and balancing the complex tradeoff between model accuracy and interpretability.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3225509","Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1913,VUW1914); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge (SfTI) Fund(grant numbers:E3603/2903); Victoria University of Wellington Research(grant numbers:225233/4077,223805/3986,226161/4164,410128/4223); MBIE Data Science SSIF Fund(grant numbers:RTVU1914); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61876169); Huayin Medical(grant numbers:E3791/4165); MBIE Endeavor Research Programme(grant numbers:C11X2001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9965435","Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI);Genetic programming (GP)","Machine learning;Genetic programming;Task analysis;Predictive models;Adaptation models;Training;Measurement","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","black-box machine learning models;explainable artificial intelligence;genetic programming;GP;intrinsic interpretability;linear models;model accuracy;model interpretability;model structure;neural networks;standard machine learning models;symbolic components;XAI","","2","","290","IEEE","28 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the considered ROOT problems in this article, the main goal is to find solutions that maximize the average number of environments where they remain acceptable. In the state-of-the-art methods developed to tackle these problems, the decision makers/metrics used to select solutions for deployment mostly make simplifying assumptions about the problem instances.

However, many EOPs have not only expensive objective but also expensive constraints, which are evaluated through distributed ways. We define this kind of EOPs as distributed expensive constrained optimization problems (DECOPs). The distributed characteristic of DECOPs leads to the asynchronous evaluation of both objective and constraints. Though some researchers have studied the asynchronous evaluation of objectives, the asynchronous evaluation of constraints has not gained much attention. Therefore, this article gives a formal formulation of DECOPs and proposes a distributed evolutionary constrained optimization algorithm with on-demand evaluation (DEAOE). DEAOE can adaptively evolve different constraints in an asynchronous way through the on-demand evaluation strategy. The on-demand evaluation works from two aspects to improve the population convergence and diversity. From the aspect of individual selection, a joint sample selection strategy is adopted to determine which candidates are promising. From the aspect of constraint selection, an infeasible-first evaluation strategy is devised to judge which constraints need to be further evolved. Extensive experiments and analyses on benchmark functions and engineering problems demonstrate that DEAOE has better performance and higher efficiency compared to centralized state-of-the-art SAEAs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3177936","National Key Research and Development Project, Ministry of Science and Technology, China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976093,61873097); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2021H1D3A2A01082705); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation Research Team(grant numbers:2018B030312003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9782569","Differential evolution (DE);distributed optimization;on-demand evaluation;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (SAEA)","Optimization;Computational modeling;Sociology;Industries;Evolutionary computation;Predictive models;Organizations","convergence;distributed algorithms;evolutionary computation;optimisation;sampling methods","adaptive evolution;asynchronous evaluation;constraint selection;DEAOE;DECOP;distributed characteristic;distributed expensive constrained optimization problem;distributed expensive evolutionary constrained optimization;EOP;evolutionary algorithms;expensive constraints;infeasible-first evaluation strategy;joint sample selection strategy;on-demand evaluation strategy;population convergence;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm","","3","","58","IEEE","26 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So far, the research on noise-tolerant optimization algorithms is still restricted to low-dimensional problems with less than 100 decision variables. In reality, many problems are high dimensional. Cooperative coevolutionary (CC) algorithms based on a divide-and-conquer strategy are promising in solving complex high-dimensional problems. However, noisy fitness evaluations pose a challenge in problem decomposition for CC. The state-of-the-art grouping methods, such as differential grouping (DG) and recursive DG, are unable to work properly in noisy environments. Because it is impossible to distinguish whether the change of one variable’s difference value is caused by noise or the perturbation of its interacting variables. As a result, every pair of variables will be identified as nonseparable in these methods. In this article, we study how to group decision variables with the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) in noisy environments and subsequently propose a landscape-aware grouping (LAG) method. Instead of detecting pairwise interacting variables, we directly identify a nonseparable subcomponent. To this end, we propose to use two convergence features: 1) variable convergence time and 2) accumulative path, to describe variables’ fitness landscapes; then, variables are clustered according to these two features. Numerical experiments show that LAG can more effectively identify interactive decision variables in the presence of multiplicative noise than the DG and some of its variants. Up to 500 dimensions, the performance of CC CMA-ES with landscape-aware grouping (CC-CMAES-LAG) is competitive compared with existing CC algorithms and uncertainty-handling CMA-ES (UH-CMA-ES).","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3180224","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076203,61976165); Alexander von Humboldt Professorship for Artificial Intelligence; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9787998","Covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES);cooperative coevolution;landscape-aware grouping (LAG);noisy environment;variable grouping","Noise measurement;Covariance matrices;Optimization;Convergence;Uncertainty;Sociology;Perturbation methods","convergence;covariance matrices;divide and conquer methods;evolutionary computation;optimisation","CC CMA-ES;coevolutionary CMA-ES;convergence features;cooperative coevolutionary algorithms;covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy;differential grouping;divide-and-conquer strategy;high-dimensional problems;interactive decision variables;landscape-aware grouping method;low-dimensional problems;multiplicative noise;noise-tolerant optimization algorithm;noisy environments;noisy fitness evaluation;nonseparable subcomponent identification;pairwise interacting variables;problem decomposition;UH-CMA-ES;uncertainty-handling CMA-ES;variable convergence time","","4","","55","IEEE","3 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article introduces a novel optimization framework to solve costly optimization problems, called the evolutionary sampling agent (ESA). ESA considers the optimization algorithm as an agent, which operates on four different characteristics of evolutionary sampling strategies to search the global optimum. Among these four evolutionary sampling strategies, the first strategy prefers exploration, the second and the fourth strategies use different local search methods preferring exploitation, and the third strategy integrates good genes from historical solutions. ESA consists of two layers of learning mechanisms. On the one hand, the evolutionary sampling strategies use historical data to construct surrogate models to efficiently sample a candidate solution. On the other hand, the agent adjusts the probability of selecting different sampling strategies through the feedback information received in the optimization process. Seven benchmark functions with 30, 50, and 100 dimensions were adopted. Compared with the other state-of-the-art methods, the results show that ESA yields a promising performance for expensive problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3177605","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076225); Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Hubei(grant numbers:2019CFA081); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9780561","Agent;evolutionary algorithm;expensive optimization;reinforcement learning (RL);surrogate model","Optimization;Iron;Data models;Uncertainty;Search problems;Approximation algorithms;Virtual environments","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;search problems","costly optimization problems;data-driven evolutionary algorithms;ESA;evolutionary sampling agent;evolutionary sampling strategies;expensive optimization problems;learning mechanisms;local search methods","","5","","64","IEEE","24 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing methods usually ignore the similarities among component layers of a multiplex network when detecting its community structures, which decreases the detection efficiency. In this article, we decompose the community detection in multiplex networks into two problems and propose a novel algorithm that can detect both the specific community partition for each component layer (layer-level community structure) and the composite community structure shared by all layers. First, by specifying the modularity optimization on a network layer as an optimization task, we model the layer-level community detection as a multitask optimization (MTO) problem and employ an evolutionary MTO algorithm to solve it. In this way, the topology correlations among different layers can be utilized to facilitate the community detection. Second, we propose an evolutionary clustering ensemble method to find the composite community structure based on the layer-level community partitions and the multiplex network. The proposed method is tested on both synthetic and real-world benchmark networks and compared with classical and state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has superior community detection performances on multiplex networks.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3184988","Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20200109141235597); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61761136008); Shenzhen Peacock Plan(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9802693","Community detection;evolutionary multitask optimization (EMTO);multiplex networks","Multiplexing;Optimization;Task analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Multitasking;Search problems;Topology","evolutionary computation;network theory (graphs);pattern clustering","community detection performances;community structures;component layer;composite community structure;detection efficiency;evolutionary clustering ensemble method;evolutionary MTO algorithm;evolutionary multitask optimization;layer-level community detection;layer-level community partitions;layer-level community structure;modularity optimization;multiplex network;network layer;network science;real-world benchmark networks","","2","","49","IEEE","21 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
