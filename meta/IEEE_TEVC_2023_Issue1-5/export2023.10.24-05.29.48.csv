CV includes methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images. The aim is to design computational models of human and animal perception. ECV is an interdisciplinary research area where analytical methods combined with powerful stochastic optimization and metaheuristic approaches produced human-competitive results. From an engineering standpoint, ECV aims to design software and hardware solutions useful for solving challenging CV problems. From a scientific viewpoint, the goal is to enhance our current understanding of visual processing in nature and replicate this within a seeing machine. ECV is a well-established research discipline as evolutionary algorithms are more efficient than classical optimization approaches for the discontinuous, nondifferentiable, multimodal, and noisy search, optimization, and learning problems arising in many CV tasks. EC has also demonstrated its ability as a robust approach to cope with the fundamental steps of image processing, image analysis, and image understanding included in the CV pipeline (e.g., restoration, segmentation, registration, classification, reconstruction, or tracking).","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3235641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10032252","","Special issues and sections;Evolutionary computation;Computer vision;Stochastic processes;Research and development;Search problems","","","","","","0","IEEE","30 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, image-related tasks are very challenging due to many factors, e.g., high variations across images, high dimensionality, domain expertise requirement, and image distortions. Evolutionary computation (EC) approaches have been widely used for image analysis with significant achievement. However, there is no comprehensive survey of existing EC approaches to image analysis. To fill this gap, this article provides a comprehensive survey covering all essential EC approaches to important image analysis tasks, including edge detection, image segmentation, image feature analysis, image classification, object detection, and others. This survey aims to provide a better understanding of evolutionary CV (ECV) by discussing the contributions of different approaches and exploring how and why EC is used for CV and image analysis.

This often requires a high computational overhead to evaluate a number of candidate networks from the set of all possible networks in the search space. Prediction of the performance of a network can alleviate this high computational overhead by mitigating the need for evaluating every candidate network. Developing such a predictor typically requires a large number of evaluated architectures which may be difficult to obtain. We address this challenge by proposing a novel evolutionary-based NAS strategy, predictor-assisted evolutionary NAS (PRE-NAS) which can perform well even with an extremely small number of evaluated architectures. PRE-NAS leverages new evolutionary search strategies and integrates high-fidelity weight inheritance over generations. Unlike one-shot strategies, which may suffer from bias in the evaluation due to weight sharing, offspring candidates in PRE-NAS are topologically homogeneous. This circumvents bias and leads to more accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on the NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces show that PRE-NAS can outperform state-of-the-art NAS methods. With only a single GPU searching for 0.6 days, a competitive architecture can be found by PRE-NAS which achieves 2.40% and 24% test error rates on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, respectively.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3227562","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9975797","Convolutional neural network;evolutionary algorithm (EA);neuroevolution;performance predictor","Computer architecture;Training;Microprocessors;Statistics;Sociology;Prediction algorithms;Task analysis","genetic algorithms;neural net architecture;search problems","architecture engineering;candidate network;competitive architecture;DARTS search spaces;evolutionary neural architecture search;evolutionary-based NAS strategy;high computational overhead;high-fidelity weight inheritance;neural networks;PRE-NAS;predictor-assisted evolutionary NAS;single GPU searching","","","","53","IEEE","8 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is therefore necessary to restore clean HSIs. In the traditional methods, low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition methods are usually applied to restore the pure data matrix from the observed data matrix. However, due to the fact that the optimization of the  ${l}_{0}$ -norm for the sparse modeling is a nonconvex and NP-hard problem, convex relaxation and regularization parameters are usually introduced. However, convex relaxation often leads to inaccurate sparse modeling results, and the sensitive regularization parameters can lead to unstable results. Thus, in this article, to address these issues, an accurate multiobjective low-rank and sparse denoising framework is proposed for HSIs to achieve accurate modeling. The  ${l}_{0}$ -norm is directly modeled as the sparse noise and is optimized by an evolutionary algorithm, and the denoising problem is converted into a multiobjective optimization problem through simultaneously optimizing the low-rank term, the sparse term, and the data fidelity term, without sensitive regularization parameters. However, since the low-rank clean image and sparse noise of the HSI are encoded into a solution, the length of the solution is too long to be optimized. In this article, a subfitness strategy is constructed to achieve effective optimization by comparing the objective function values corresponding to each band for each solution. The experiments undertaken with simulated images in 11 noise cases and four real noisy images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3078478","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0504202); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41801267,42071350,41771385); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9426935","Denoising;evolutionary algorithm;hyperspectral imagery;low-rank and sparse;multiobjective optimization;spatial–spectral total variation (SSTV)","Noise reduction;Optimization;Sparse matrices;Noise measurement;Image restoration;Task analysis;Hyperspectral imaging","convex programming;evolutionary computation;Gaussian noise;hyperspectral imaging;image denoising;matrix decomposition","clean HSIs;convex relaxation;data acquisition;data fidelity term;evolutionary algorithm;Gaussian noise;hyperspectral image denoising method;hyperspectral images;low-rank clean image;multiobjective sparse model;multiobjective low-rank model;multiobjective optimization problem;noisy images;nonconvex problem;NP-hard problem;observed data matrix;sensitive regularization parameters;simulated images;sparse matrix decomposition methods;sparse noise","","7","","70","IEEE","10 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Exploiting deep learning and introducing compact WSI representations are urgently needed to accelerate image analysis and facilitate the visualization and interpretability of pathology results in a postpandemic world. In this article, we introduce a new evolutionary approach for WSI representation based on large-scale multiobjective optimization (LSMOP) of deep embeddings. We start with patch-based sampling to feed KimiaNet, a histopathology-specialized deep network, and to extract a multitude of feature vectors. Coarse multiobjective feature selection uses the reduced search space strategy guided by the classification accuracy and the number of features. In the second stage, the frequent features histogram (FFH), a novel WSI representation, is constructed by multiple runs of coarse LSMOP. Fine evolutionary feature selection is then applied to find a compact (short-length) feature vector based on the FFH and contributes to a more robust deep-learning approach to digital pathology supported by the stochastic power of evolutionary algorithms. We validate the proposed schemes using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) images in terms of WSI representation, classification accuracy, and feature quality. Furthermore, a novel decision space for multicriteria decision making in the LSMOP field is introduced. Finally, a patch-level visualization approach is proposed to increase the interpretability of deep features. The proposed evolutionary algorithm finds a very compact feature vector to represent a WSI (almost 14000 times smaller than the original feature vectors) with 8% higher accuracy compared to the codes provided by the state-of-the-art methods","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3178299","Ontario Research Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9782691","Deep neural network (DNN);digital pathology;dimension reduction;evolutionary computation (EC);feature selection;image representation;innovization;large-scale multiobjective optimization (LSMOP);transfer learning","Feature extraction;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Data mining;Histopathology;Cancer;Task analysis","cancer;decision making;deep learning (artificial intelligence);evolutionary computation;feature extraction;genomics;image classification;image representation;medical image processing","cancer genome atlas images;classification accuracy;coarse LSMOP;coarse multiobjective feature selection;compact feature vector;decision space;deep embeddings;deep features;deep learning;deep learning approach;digital pathology;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary approach;evolutionary computation;FFH;fine evolutionary feature selection;frequent features histogram;gigapixel pathology;histopathology specialized deep network;hyperdimensional deep embedding spaces;hyperdimensional digitized biopsy samples;image analysis;large-scale multiobjective optimization;LSMOP field;novel WSI representation;original feature vectors;patch level visualization approach;pathology results;postpandemic world;reduced search space strategy;slide images","","","","40","IEEE","26 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To enhance the efficiency of tackling LMOPs, this article proposes an accelerated evolutionary search (AES) strategy. Its main idea is to learn a gradient-descent-like direction vector (GDV) for each solution via the specially trained feedforward neural network, which may be the learnt possibly fastest convergent direction to reproduce new solutions efficiently. To be specific, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with only one hidden layer is constructed, in which the number of neurons in the input and output layers is equal to the dimension of the decision space. Then, to get appropriate training data for the model, the current population is divided into two subsets based on the nondominated sorting, and each poor solution in one subset with worse convergence will be paired to an elitist solution in another subset with the minimum angle to it, which is considered most likely to guide it with rapid convergence. Next, this MLP is updated via backpropagation with gradient descent by using the above elaborately prepared dataset. Finally, an accelerated large-scale multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (ALMOEA) is designed by using AES as a reproduction operator. Experimental studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed AES when handling the search space of LMOPs with dimensionality ranging from 1000 to 10000. When compared with six state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, the experimental results also show the better efficiency and performance of the proposed optimizer in solving various LMOPs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3155593","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U21A20512,61876162,61876110); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong(grant numbers:PolyU11202418,PolyU11211521,PolyU11209219); Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20190808164211203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9723458","Accelerated evolutionary search (AES);large-scale multiobjective optimization;multilayer perceptron (MLP)","Search problems;Statistics;Sociology;Convergence;Optimization;Multilayer perceptrons;Maintenance engineering","backpropagation;evolutionary computation;feedforward neural nets;gradient methods;multilayer perceptrons;search problems","accelerated evolutionary search strategy;accelerated large-scale multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;AES;ALMOEA;backpropagation;convergent direction;decision space;evolutionary search strategies;feedforward neural network;gradient descent;gradient-descent-like direction vector;hidden layer;large-scale multiobjective optimization problems;LMOPs;MLP;multilayer perceptron;nondominated sorting;search space;state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms;subset;worse convergence","","7","","58","IEEE","1 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With program synthesis techniques not only software developers could be supported in their everyday work but even users without any programming knowledge could be empowered to automate repetitive tasks and implement their own new functionality. In recent years, many novel program synthesis approaches based on evolutionary algorithms have been proposed and evaluated on common benchmark problems. Therefore, we identify and discuss in this survey the relevant evolutionary program synthesis approaches in the literature and provide an in-depth analysis of their performance. The most influential approaches we identify are stack-based, grammar-guided, as well as linear genetic programming (GP). For the stack-based approaches, we identify 37 in-scope papers, and for the grammar-guided and linear GP approaches, we identify 12 and 5 papers, respectively. Furthermore, we find that these approaches perform well on benchmark problems if there is a simple mapping from the given input to the correct output. On problems where this mapping is complex, e.g., if the problem consists of several subproblems or requires iteration/recursion for a correct solution, results tend to be worse. Consequently, for future work, we encourage researchers not only to use a program’s output for assessing the quality of a solution but also the way toward a solution (e.g., correctly solved subproblems).","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3162324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743417","Benchmarks;evolutionary algorithms;genetic programming (GP);program synthesis","Benchmark testing;Evolutionary computation;Programming;Natural languages;Codes;Python;Task analysis","automatic programming;genetic algorithms;grammars;linear programming;software engineering","automatic generation;computer programs;evolutionary algorithms;evolutionary computation;evolutionary program synthesis approaches;grammar-guided approach;linear genetic programming;linear GP approaches;programming knowledge;stack-based approaches","","12","","107","IEEE","25 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, a more practical situation in engineering problems is that one solution is slightly worse than another in terms of objective values, while the solutions are far away in the decision space. In other words, such problems have global and local Pareto fronts (PFs). In this study, we proposed several benchmark problems with several local PFs. Then, we proposed an evolutionary algorithm with a hierarchy ranking method (HREA) to find both the global and the local PFs based on the decision maker’s preference. Regarding HREA, we proposed a local convergence quality evaluation method to better maintain diversity in the decision space.

It is not uncommon that the objective functions are as a black box, the evaluation of which usually involve time-consuming and/or costly physical experiments. Data-driven evolutionary optimization can be used to search for a set of nondominated tradeoff solutions, where the expensive objective functions are approximated as a surrogate model. In this article, we propose a framework for implementing batched data-driven evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO). It is so general that any off-the-shelf EMO algorithms can be applied in a plug-in manner. There are two unique components: 1) based on the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, a manifold interpolation approach that explores more diversified solutions with a convergence guarantee along the manifold of the approximated Pareto-optimal set and 2) a batch recommendation approach that reduces the computational time of the data-driven evolutionary optimization process by evaluating multiple samples at a time in parallel. Comparing against seven state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms, experiments on 168 benchmark test problem instances with various properties and a real-world application on hyper-parameter optimization fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed framework, which is featured with a faster convergence and a stronger resilience to various Pareto-optimal front shapes.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3162993","UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship(grant numbers:MR/S017062/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:2404317); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076056); Royal Society(grant numbers:IES/R2/212077); Amazon Research Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9744035","Evolutionary algorithm (EA);Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions;multiobjective optimization;surrogate modeling","Optimization;Manifolds;Linear programming;Iron;Computational modeling;Search problems;Interpolation","evolutionary computation;interpolation;Pareto optimisation","approximated Pareto-optimal set;batch recommendation approach;batched data-driven evolutionary multiobjective optimization;benchmark test problem instances;costly physical experiments;data-driven evolutionary optimization process;design optimization problems;expensive objective functions;hyper-parameter optimization;Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions;manifold interpolation approach;multiobjective optimization problems;nondominated tradeoff solutions;off-the-shelf EMO algorithms;Pareto-optimal front shapes;real-world science;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms","","3","","70","IEEE","29 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Efficient distribution of vaccines to inoculation spots is crucial to curtailing the spread of the novel COVID-19 pandemic. Normally, in a big city, a huge number of vaccines need to be transported from central depot(s) through a set of satellites to widely scattered inoculation spots by special-purpose vehicles every day. Such a large two-echelon vehicle routing problem is computationally difficult. Moreover, the demands for vaccines evolve with the epidemic spread over time, and the actual demands are hard to determine early and exactly, which not only increases the problem difficulty but also prolongs the distribution time. Based on our practical experience of COVID-19 vaccine distribution in China, we present a hybrid machine learning and evolutionary computation method, which first uses a fuzzy deep learning model to forecast the demands for vaccines for each next day, such that we can predistribute the forecasted number of vaccines to the satellites in advance; after obtaining the actual demands, it uses an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to route vehicles to distribute vaccines from the satellites/depots to the inoculation spots on each day. The EA saves historical problem instances and their high-quality solutions in a knowledge base, so as to capture inherent relationship between evolving problem inputs to solutions; when solving a new problem instance on each day, the EA utilizes historical solutions that perform well on the similar instances to improve initial solution quality and, hence, accelerate convergence.

However, little effort has been made to explore what information among different tasks can be used as valuable knowledge to help the optimization of different tasks. This article proposes a multiobjective multitask optimization (MO-MTO) EA based on decomposition with dual neighborhoods (MTEA/D-DN), in which the neighborhood is used as a bridge to achieve knowledge transfer among different tasks. In MTEA/D-DN, each subproblem not only maintains a neighborhood (internal neighborhood) within its own task based on the Euclidean distance between weight vectors but also keeps a neighborhood (external neighborhood) with the subproblems of other tasks via gray relation analysis in order to mine valuable information and communicate among tasks. The experimental studies show that our proposed algorithm outperforms five other state-of-the-art algorithms on a set of benchmark test instances and a real-world problem in steel plant.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3154416","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1700404); Major Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71790614); Fund for the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62073067); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:B16009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9721409","Decomposition;evolutionary algorithm (EA);multiobjective multitask optimization (MO-MTO);neighborhood","Task analysis;Optimization;Knowledge transfer;Evolutionary computation;Sociology;Collaboration;Bridges","evolutionary computation;optimisation;vectors","benchmark test instances;Euclidean distance;evolutionary algorithms;external neighborhood;gray relation analysis;implicit parallelism;internal neighborhood;knowledge transfer;MO-MTO EA;MTEA/D-DN;multiobjective multitask optimization EA based on decomposition with dual neighborhoods;multiobjective multitask optimization-neighborhood;weight vectors","","14","","52","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A Fast Multipoint Expected Improvement for Parallel Expensive Optimization","D. Zhan; Y. Meng; H.

However, the exact calculation of the classical multipoint EI involves evaluating a significant amount of multivariate normal cumulative distribution functions, which makes the inner optimization of this infill criterion very time consuming when the number of infill samples is large. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel fast multipoint EI criterion in this work. The proposed infill criterion is calculated using only univariate normal cumulative distributions; thus, it is easier to implement and cheaper to compute than the classical multipoint EI criterion. It is shown that the computational time of the proposed fast multipoint EI is several orders lower than the classical multipoint EI on the benchmark problems. In addition, we propose to use cooperative coevolutionary algorithms (CCEAs) to solve the inner optimization problem of the proposed fast multipoint EI by decomposing the optimization problem into multiple subproblems with each subproblem corresponding to one infill sample and solving these subproblems cooperatively. Numerical experiments show that using CCEAs can improve the performance of the proposed algorithm significantly compared with using standard evolutionary algorithms. This work provides a fast and efficient approach for parallel expensive optimization.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3168060","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62106207); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9758830","Efficient global optimization (EGO);expensive optimization;Kriging model;multipoint expected improvement (EI);parallel computing","Optimization;Correlation;Approximation algorithms;Uncertainty;Standards;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","evolutionary computation;parallel processing","CCEA;cooperative coevolutionary algorithms;fast multipoint expected improvement;inner optimization problem;multipoint EI criterion;multivariate normal cumulative distribution functions;parallel expensive optimization;parallel infill criterion;univariate normal cumulative distributions","","2","","47","IEEE","18 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most of the existing KT methods still face two challenges. First, the tasks may commonly have different dimensionalities (DDs), making the KT between heterogeneous search spaces very difficult. Second, the tasks may have different degrees of similarity in different dimensions, making that treating all dimensions with equal importance may be harmful to the KT process. To address these two challenges, this article proposes a novel orthogonal transfer (OT) method that is enabled by a cross-task mapping (CTM) strategy, which can achieve high-quality KT among heterogeneous tasks. For the first challenge, the CTM strategy maps the global best individual of one task from its original search space to the search space of the target task via an optimization process, which can handle the difference in task dimensionality. For the second challenge, the OT method is performed on the CTM-obtained individual and a random individual of the target task to find the best combination of different dimensions in these two individuals rather than treating all the dimensions equally, so as to achieve high-quality KT. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed OT method and the resulted OT-based multitask optimization (OTMTO) algorithm, this article not only uses the existing multitask optimization benchmark but also proposes a new benchmark test suite named multitask optimization problems (MTOPs) with DDs. Comprehensive experimental results on the existing and the proposed benchmarks show that the proposed OT method and the OTMTO algorithm are very advantageous in providing high-quality KT and in handling the heterogeneity of search space in MTOPs compared to the existing competitive evolutionary multitask optimization (EMTO) algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3160196","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2102102); National Natural Science Foundations of China(grant numbers:62176094,61873097); Key-Area Research and Development of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B010166002); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation Research Team(grant numbers:2018B030312003); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2021H1D3A2A01082705); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9737234","Differential evolution (DE);evolutionary computation (EC);evolutionary multitask optimization (EMTO);knowledge transfer (KT);orthogonal experimental design (OED);orthogonal transfer (OT)","Task analysis;Optimization;Benchmark testing;Statistics;Sociology;Search problems;Transfer learning","evolutionary computation;knowledge management;optimisation;search problems","competitive evolutionary multitask optimization algorithms;cross-task mapping strategy;CTM strategy maps;DDs;different dimensionalities;EMTO;global best individual;heterogeneous search spaces;high-quality KT;knowledge transfer;MTOPs;orthogonal transfer method;OT-based multitask optimization algorithm;OTMTO;random individual;task dimensionality","","10","","66","CCBY","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
