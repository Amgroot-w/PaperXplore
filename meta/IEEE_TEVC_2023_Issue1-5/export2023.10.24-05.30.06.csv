Optimization is at the heart of many machine-learning techniques. However, there is still room to exploit optimization in machine learning. Every machine-learning technique has hyperparameters that can be tuned using evolutionary computation and optimization, considering normally multiple criteria, such as bias, variance, complexity, and fairness in model selection. Multiobjective evolutionary optimization can help meet these criteria for optimizing machine-learning models. Some of the existing approaches address these multiple criteria by transforming the problem into a single-objective optimization problem. However, multiobjective optimization models are able to outperform single-objective ones in contributing to multiple intended objectives (criteria). In recent years, evolutionary computation has been shown to be the premier method for solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), producing both optimal and diverse solutions beyond the capabilities of other heuristics. This is particularly true for very large solution spaces, which is the case in real-world machine-learning problems with many features.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3292528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10198500","","Special issues and sections;Pareto optimization;Evolutionary computation;Machine learning;Optimization methods","","","","","","0","IEEE","1 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is a paradox in conventional evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) that always aim to achieve a well balance between convergence and diversity. In essence, the ultimate goal of multiobjective optimization is to help a DM identify solution(s) of interest (SOI) achieving satisfactory tradeoffs among multiple conflicting criteria. Bearing this in mind, this article develops a framework for designing preference-based EMO algorithms to find SOI in an interactive manner. Its core idea is to involve human in the loop of EMO. After every several iterations, the DM is invited to elicit her feedback with regard to a couple of incumbent candidates. By collecting such information, her preference is progressively learned by a learning-to-rank neural network and then applied to guide the baseline EMO algorithm. Note that this framework is so general that any existing EMO algorithm can be applied in a plug-in manner. Experiments on 48 benchmark test problems with up to ten objectives and a real-world multiobjective robot control problem fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms for finding SOI.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3234269","UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship(grant numbers:MR/S017062/1,MR/X011135/1); NSFC(grant numbers:62076056); Royal Society(grant numbers:IES/R2/212077); EPSRC(grant numbers:2404317); Amazon Research Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10015671","Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO);gradient descent;learning to rank (LTR);preference modeling","Optimization;Genetic algorithms;Programming;Fuzzy logic;Statistics;Sociology;Evolutionary computation","decision making;evolutionary computation;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematics computing;neural nets;Pareto optimisation","baseline EMO algorithm;benchmark test problems;conventional evolutionary multiobjective optimization;convergence;decision maker;DM;EMO;information collection;interactive evolutionary multiobjective optimization;learning-to-rank neural network;multicriterion decision making;multiple conflicting criteria;Pareto-optimal front;preference-based EMO algorithms;real-world multiobjective robot control problem;SOI;solution of interest","","1","","72","IEEE","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in real-world scenarios, obtaining accurate labels is very hard and expensive, especially, when multiple data streams are concurrently sampled from an environment or the same process. To address this issue, multistream classification is proposed, in which a data stream with biased labels (called the source stream) is leveraged to train a suitable model for prediction over another stream with unlabeled samples (called the target stream). Despite the growing research in this field, previous multistream classification methods are mostly designed for single-source stream scenarios. However, various source streams contain diverse data distributions, providing more valuable information for building a more accurate model. In addition, previous works construct classification models in the original shared feature space, ignoring the effect of redundant or low-quality features on the classification performance. This may produce inefficient knowledge transfer across streams. In view of this, a reduced-space multistream classification based on multiobjective evolutionary optimization is proposed in this article. First, a multiobjective evolutionary optimization is employed to seek the most valuable feature subset shared in the source and target domains, with the purpose of narrowing the distribution difference between source and target streams. Following that, a Gaussian mixture model-based weighting mechanism for source samples is presented. More especially, two drift adaptation methods are proposed to address asynchronous drift. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms other comparative methods on classification accuracy and G-mean.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3232466","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973305,61573361,52121003); Foundation of Key Laboratory of System Control and Information Processing, Ministry of Education, China(grant numbers:Scip202203); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB4703701); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9999543","Concept drift;domain adaption;feature selection;multiobjective optimization;multistream classification","Feature extraction;Data models;Adaptation models;Optimization;Predictive models;Buildings;Labeling","data mining;evolutionary computation;Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);mixture models;optimisation;pattern classification","asynchronous drift;biased labels;classification performance;data distributions;data stream mining;drift adaptation methods;feature space;feature subset;Gaussian mixture model-based weighting mechanism;multiobjective evolutionary optimization;reduced-space multistream classification;source domains;source samples;source stream;target domains;target streams;unlabeled samples","","1","","60","IEEE","27 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Combining evolutionary computation and neural architecture search (NAS) is an important approach to improve the performance of deep neural networks. Usually, the related researchers only focus on precision. Thus, the searched neural architectures always perform poorly in the other indexes such as time cost. In this article, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a probability stack (MOEA-PS) is proposed for NAS, which considers the two objects of precision and time consumption. MOEA-PS uses an adjacency list to represent the internal structure of deep neural networks. Besides, a unique mechanism is introduced into the multi-objective genetic algorithm to guide the process of crossover and mutation when generating offspring. Furthermore, the structure blocks are stacked using a proxy model to generate deep neural networks. The results of the experiments on Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a similar error rate compared with the most advanced NAS algorithms, but the time cost is lower. Finally, the network structure searched on Cifar-10 is transferred directly to the ImageNet dataset, which can achieve 73.6% classification accuracy.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3252612","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876089,61876185,61902281); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20141005); Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China(grant numbers:14KJB520025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10059145","Deep learning;evolutionary computation;multi-objective optimization;neural architecture search (NAS)","Computer architecture;Classification algorithms;Statistics;Sociology;Graphics processing units;Neural networks;Evolutionary computation","deep learning (artificial intelligence);evolutionary computation;genetic algorithms;image classification;natural language processing;neural net architecture;object detection;search problems;speech recognition","deep neural networks;MOEA-PS;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective genetic algorithm;neural architecture search;object detection;probability stack;searched neural architectures","","4","","51","IEEE","6 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most existing LFS algorithms lack a problem-specific objective function and instead simply apply the distance-like objective function, which limits their classification performance. In addition, obtaining a good LFS model is essentially a multiobjective optimization problem. Therefore, in this article, we propose a region purity (RP)-based LFS (RP-LFS) where, besides the proportion of the selected features and region-based distance metric, we design a novel objective function, RP, from the perspective of combining local features with classifiers. To solve the RP-LFS, an improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III is proposed. Specifically, a network-inspired crossover operator and a quick bit mutation are applied, which can improve the ability to search for better solutions. A regional feature sharing strategy between different local models is developed, which can preserve more effective features. Experimental studies on 11 UCI datasets and nine high-dimensional datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed RP. In comparison with various state-of-the-art FS and LFS algorithms, RP-LFS can achieve very competitive classification accuracy while obtaining a reduced feature subset size.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3222297","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61702336); Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program(grant numbers:JCYJ2020010911041013); Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Commission (InnoHK Project CIMDA); Hong Kong GRF-RGC General Research Fund(grant numbers:11209819 (CityU 9042816),11203820 (CityU 9042598)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9953116","Local feature selection (LFS);multiobjective optimization;region purity (RP);regional feature sharing strategy (RFSS)","Genetic algorithms;Feature extraction;Optimization;Measurement;Linear programming;Training;Convergence","feature extraction;feature selection;genetic algorithms;pattern classification;sorting","improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III;LFS model;multiobjective optimization problem;multiobjective perspective;problem-specific objective function;reduced feature subset size;region purity-based LFS;region purity-based local feature selection;region-based distance;regional feature sharing strategy;RP-LFS;traditional feature selection","","3","","49","IEEE","16 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, this article devises a new EMT algorithm for FS in high-dimensional classification, which first adopts different filtering methods to produce multiple tasks and then modifies a competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) to efficiently solve these related tasks via knowledge transfer. First, a diversified multiple task generation method is designed based on multiple filtering methods, which generates several relevant low-dimensional FS tasks by eliminating irrelevant features. In this way, useful knowledge for solving simple and relevant tasks can be transferred to simplify and speed up the solution of the original high-dimensional FS task. Then, a CSO is modified to simultaneously solve these relevant FS tasks by transferring useful knowledge among them. Numerous empirical results demonstrate that the proposed EMT-based FS method can obtain a better feature subset than several state-of-the-art FS methods on 18 high-dimensional datasets.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3254155","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U21A20512,61876162,62276222,61836005,62272315); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong(grant numbers:PolyU11211521,PolyU15218622); Hong Kong Polytechnic University under Project(grant numbers:1-ZE0C); Guangdong Regional Joint Foundation Key Project(grant numbers:2022B1515120076); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20220531101411027,JCYJ20190808164211203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064013","Competitive swarm optimizer (CSO);evolutionary algorithm (EA);evolutionary multitasking (EMT);feature selection (FS);high-dimensional classification","Task analysis;Knowledge transfer;Convergence;Filtering;Feature extraction;Multitasking;Search problems","evolutionary computation;feature extraction;feature selection;particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification","EMT algorithm;EMT-based feature selection methods;EMT-based FS method;evolutionary multitasking algorithm;feature subset;high-dimensional classification;high-dimensional feature selection;high-dimensional FS task;knowledge transfer;low-dimensional FS tasks;multiple task generation method;Relief-F method","","2","","60","IEEE","8 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To make the attack more practical, we exploit a query-based method to generate image AEs in a black-box attack setting. Considering that the generation of AEs is inherently a constrained optimization problem, this article first formulates three objectives regarding defensive DNNs, i.e., attack effectiveness, attack evasiveness and attack coverage. Then, this article proposes a query-efficient AE attack based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to address the perturbation optimization problem. To improve the efficiency of search and query, AE-specific operators including block-level and pixel-level crossovers, discrete perturbation mutation and direction-driven reproduction are designed within the GA-based search framework. In addition, predication-based adaptation of reproduction-related parameters is implemented to speed up the search convergence. PSO-based jumping process is further devised to avoid stuck in local optimum. Benchmark-based experiments evaluated the efficiency of our method, which can achieve an attack success rate of 100% with averagely 52.95% reduced queries in contrast to existing black-box attacks on nondefensive models.

Optimizing one or several fairness measures may sacrifice or deteriorate other measures. Two key questions should be considered: 1) how to simultaneously optimize accuracy and multiple fairness measures and 2) how to optimize all the considered fairness measures more effectively. In this article, we view the mitigating unfairness problem as a multiobjective learning problem, considering the conflicts among fairness measures. A multiobjective evolutionary learning framework is used to simultaneously optimize several metrics (including accuracy and multiple fairness measures) of ML models. Then, ensembles are constructed based on the learning models in order to automatically balance different metrics. Empirical results on eight well-known datasets demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for mitigating unfairness, our proposed algorithm can provide decision makers with better tradeoffs among accuracy and multiple fairness metrics.

To fill this research gap, this article proposes a new multitasking ETO algorithm via a powerful transfer learning model to simultaneously solve multiple LMOPs. In particular, inspired by adversarial domain adaptation in transfer learning, a discriminative reconstruction network (DRN) model (containing an encoder, a decoder, and a classifier) is created for each LMOP. At each generation, the DRN is trained by the currently obtained nondominated solutions for all LMOPs via backpropagation with gradient descent. With this well-trained DRN model, the proposed algorithm can transfer the solutions of source LMOPs directly to the target LMOP for assisting its optimization, can evaluate the correlation between the source and target LMOPs to control the transfer of solutions, and can learn a dimensional-reduced Pareto-optimal subspace of the target LMOP to improve the efficiency of transfer optimization in the large-scale search space. Moreover, we propose a real-world multitasking LMOP suite to simulate the training of deep neural networks (DNNs) on multiple different classification tasks.

Multiple-input multiple-output nonlinear auto-regressive exogenous deep neural networks are frequently used to predict a day before, air-quality pollution incidents, at a country scale. With complexity and data sizes increasing, finding performant models becomes harder. We propose island transpeciation to optimize hyperparameters and architectures. Unlike using a single optimizer, island transpeciation combines results from multiple optimizers, to consistently provide excellent performance. Moreover, we show that island transpeciation outperforms random model search and other previous modeling efforts. Island transpeciation is a neural architecture search that uses co-evolution (genes), to combine (transpeciation) populations of incompatible optimizers (species) organized in island formations. In island transpeciation, architecture search is parallelized and utilizes a distributed pool of hardware resources.

From this cut-points vector, the decision of deleting or selecting any feature is induced. Indeed, the number of generated cut-points varies from one feature to another. Thus, the higher the number of cut-points, the higher the probability of selecting the considered feature; and vice versa. This fact leads to the deletion of possibly important features having a single or a low number of cut-points, such as the infection rate, the glycemia level, and the blood pressure. In order to solve the issue of the dependency relation between the feature selection (or removal) event and the number of its generated potential cut-points, we propose to model the DBFS task as a bilevel optimization problem and then solve it using an improved version of an existing co-evolutionary algorithm, named I-CEMBA. The latter ensures the variation of the number of features during the migration process in order to deal with the multimodality aspect. The resulting algorithm, termed bilevel discretization-based feature selection (Bi-DFS), performs selection at the upper level while discretization is done at the lower level. The experimental results on several high-dimensional datasets show that Bi-DFS outperforms relevant state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy, generalization ability, and feature selection bias.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3192113","CONACyT (Investigación en Fronteras de la Ciencia 2016)(grant numbers:2016-01-1920); Basque Government through the BERC 2022-2025 Program; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO: BCAM Severo Ochoa Excellence Accreditation(grant numbers:SEV-2017-0718); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9832651","Bilevel optimization;co-evolutionary algorithm;cut-points search;discretization-based feature selection (DBFS);features interactions","Feature extraction;Task analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning;Data mining;Metaheuristics;Genetic algorithms","evolutionary computation;feature selection;metaheuristics;vectors","Bi-DFS;bilevel discretization-based feature selection;bilevel optimization;co-evolutionary algorithm;cut-points vector;DBFS;dependency relation;discretization-based feature selection;I-CEMBA;metaheuristic algorithms","","","","46","IEEE","18 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article proposes a high-fidelity-dominance principle that factors all the three HDM elements, explicitly and simultaneously, and without requiring tuning of any parameter. This principle has been implemented in a reference-vector-based framework, leading to a computationally efficient many-objective evolutionary algorithm (MaOEA), namely, localized high-fidelity-dominance-based EA (LHFiD). Critically, LHFiD also has an inbuilt mechanism for on-the-fly determination of the timing for: 1) intermittent Nadir point estimation that enables faster convergence and 2) its self-termination that bears practically utility. This article is based on an extensive study involving 41 912 experiments, in which the proposed LHFiD approach is compared with the existing competitive MaOEAs.

We show that the three main results still hold if we replace the normal mutation with uniform inside the sphere and also with the sum of two uniforms.

To achieve the algorithm recommendation, extracting effective features to accurately characterize the problems is necessary, which is related to the feature extraction problem. So far, most feature extraction methods focus on single-objective optimization problems, and only a few studies are conducted on multiobjective optimization problems and constrained optimization problems, let alone constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) that are widely encountered in the real world. To fill the gap, this article proposes an evolution-based constrained multiobjective feature extraction method (ECMOFE), in which the information generated in the evolutionary process is leveraged to form the feature matrix. To be specific, we create two populations to, respectively, optimize constraints and objectives for some generations. Furthermore, two complementary evolutionary operators are used to generate offspring for each population. In the environmental selection, the successful rate of offspring individuals generated by each operator of each population is recorded to form the feature matrix. Then, a dimension reduction method is designed to compress the size of the feature matrix. By the above process, the feature vector that can reflect the global relationship between constraints and objectives and the difficulty of the CMOP is formed. Based on the formed features, several algorithm recommendation methods are built on the basis of classifiers. The results based on multiple metrics show the effectiveness of the proposed ECMOFE.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3186667","National Natural Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars of China(grant numbers:61922072); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62176238,61806179,61876169,62106230,61976237); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M682347,2021T140616,2021M692920); Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province(grant numbers:222300420088); Key Research and Development and Promotion Projects in Henan Province(grant numbers:192102210098); Training Program of Young Backbone Teachers in Colleges and Universities in Henan Province(grant numbers:2020GGJS006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9809966","Algorithm recommendation;constrained multiobjective optimization;feature extraction","Feature extraction;Optimization;Machine learning algorithms;Sociology;Prediction algorithms;Task analysis;Evolutionary computation","data preparation;evolutionary computation;feature extraction;matrix algebra;optimisation;recommender systems","algorithm recommendation methods;CMOP;complementary evolutionary operators;constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;constrained multiobjective optimization problems;dimension reduction method;ECMOFE;evolution-based constrained multiobjective feature extraction method;evolutionary algorithm recommendation;evolutionary process;extraction methods;feature extraction problem;feature matrix;feature vector;formed features;multiobjective feature extraction method;multiobjective optimization problems;practical application problems;single-objective optimization problems","","10","","69","IEEE","28 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a simple and efficient method, called GT-based DE (GTDE), to solve LSOPs. In the algorithm design, a simple GT-based modification is developed to perform on the best individual, comprising probabilistically targeting the location of bottleneck dimensions, constructing a homologous targeting vector, and inserting the targeting vector into the best individual. In this way, all the bottleneck dimensions of the best individual can be probabilistically targeted and modified to break the bottleneck and to provide global guidance for more optimal evolution. Note that the GT is only performed on the globally best individual and is just carried out as a simple operator that is added to the standard DE. Experimental studies compare the GTDE with some other state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms, including the winners of CEC2010, CEC2012, CEC2013, and CEC2018 competitions on large-scale optimization.

This article proposes a constrained multiobjective optimization algorithm, called CMOEA-SDE, aiming to achieve a good balance between the above two issues. To do so, CMOEA-SDE presents a strictly constrained dominance relation and a constrained shift-based density estimation strategy. Specifically, the former defines a new dominance relation that considers both constraint satisfaction and the objective functions. It favors good feasible solutions but still leaves room for infeasible solutions to be selected. Unlike most density estimation methods, which only consider the diversity of solutions, our shift-based density estimator covers both the feasibility and the diversity of solutions. That is, our estimator shifts the solutions’ positions based on the extent of the constraints they violate so that solutions violating constraints more severely are shifted to crowded areas, thus being eliminated early. Systematic experiments were conducted on four benchmark test suites and six real-world constrained multiobjective optimization problems. The experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm can achieve very competitive performance against state-of-the-art constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3190401","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71971220,71771218); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9827478","Balance between objectives and constraints;constrained optimization;evolutionary algorithms;multiobjective optimization","Optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Linear programming;Search problems;Pareto optimization;Estimation","evolutionary computation;optimisation;search problems","balancing constraints;CMOEA-SDE;constrained evolutionary multiobjective optimization;constrained multiobjective optimization algorithm;constrained shift-based density estimation strategy;constraint satisfaction;constraints satisfaction;density estimation methods;feasible solutions;infeasible regions;infeasible solutions;local optimal regions;objective functions;objectives optimization;real-world constrained multiobjective optimization problems;shift-based density estimator;state-of-the-art constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;strictly constrained dominance relation;substantial search resources","","2","","49","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a task complexity index, based on convergence rate and contribution rate, is designed to evaluate the difficulty of solving different tasks. Then, the complexity of different tasks can be evaluated in real time. Second, the skill factor of the particle is extended to a time-varying matrix according to the task complexity index. Then, the recently captured feedback is stored to determine the computational resource demands of the task. Third, an on-demand allocation strategy, based on the time-varying matrix, is developed to obtain the skill factor probability vector utilizing the attenuation accumulation method. Then, computing resources can be allocated dynamically among different tasks.

Unfortunately, the VRS is manually realized in a trial-and-error manner currently. To boost the efficiency of VRS and enable a more extensive application, we propose a variable reduction optimization problem (VROP) to represent a decision space with the smallest sets of variables. Thereafter, a heuristic rule-based automatic variable reduction algorithm (AVRA) is designed to address the VROP. AVRA sequentially reduces variables by considering several sophisticated designed heuristic rules, which search for a variable that can be utilized to represent as many variables as possible and that can be represented by the smallest set of variables possible. With AVRA, the decision variables of an optimization problem can be automatically grouped into reduced variables and core variables, where core variables can represent reduced variables and the entire decision space. During the optimization process, we only need to search the core variables to optimize the problem. Therefore, the dimensionality of the decision space can be reduced by AVRA, subsequently, simplifying the complexity of the problem and improving the search efficiency of EAs. To testify the effectiveness of AVRA, we blend AVRA with several promising EAs to solve two types of challenging problems: 1) continuous equality-constrained optimization problems and 2) nonlinear equations systems. Extensive experiments verify that an EA with AVRA outperforms the standard EA.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3199413","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62073341); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9858080","Automatic variable reduction algorithm (AVRA);equality-constrained optimization problem (ECOP);evolutionary algorithm (EA);heuristic rule;nonlinear equations system (NES);variable reduction optimization problem (VROP);variable reduction strategy (VRS)","Optimization;Mathematical models;Search problems;Standards;Reactive power;Principal component analysis;Nonlinear equations","evolutionary computation;nonlinear equations;optimisation","AVRA;core variables;corresponding optimization problems;decision variables;EA;entire decision space;evolutionary algorithms;heuristic rule-based automatic variable reduction algorithm;optimization process;reduced variables;sophisticated designed heuristic rules;variable reduction optimization problem;variable reduction strategy;VROP;VRS","","3","","55","IEEE","16 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

EMT can solve multiple related optimization tasks simultaneously and enhance the optimization of each task via knowledge sharing among tasks. Many EMT algorithms have been proposed and achieved success in various problems, yet EMT for multiobjective optimization remains a big challenge. The existing multiobjective EMT algorithms tend to suffer from slow convergence and difficulty in generating high-quality knowledge. To alleviate these issues, this article proposes a new EMT algorithm, namely, EMT-GS for multiobjective optimization based on two generative strategies. Particularly, generative adversarial networks (GANs) and inertial differential evolution (IDE) are introduced to generate transferable knowledge and offspring, respectively. A GAN is trained periodically for each source-target task pair, based on which helpful knowledge is generated from the source task and transferred to boost the solving of the target task. To accelerate the population convergence, the IDE strategy is put forward to generate offspring in a promising direction according to the individuals from the previous generation and the transferred knowledge. The performance of EMT-GS is validated on three multitasking multiobjective benchmark problems. The experimental results highlight the excellent competitiveness of EMT-GS compared to other state-of-the-art multiobjective EMT algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3189029","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB2900800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871272); National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong, China(grant numbers:2020A1515010479,2021A1515011911); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program(grant numbers:20200811181752003,JCYJ20190808173617147); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9817402","Differential evolution (DE);evolutionary multitasking (EMT);generative adversarial networks (GANs);multiobjective optimization","Task analysis;Optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Multitasking;Knowledge transfer;Knowledge engineering","evolutionary computation;neural nets;optimisation","EMT algorithm;EMT-GS;evolutionary computation;evolutionary multitasking;GAN;generative adversarial networks;high-quality knowledge;IDE strategy;inertial differential evolution;knowledge sharing;multiobjective EMT algorithms;multiobjective optimization;multitasking multiobjective benchmark problems;source-target task pair;transferable knowledge;transferred knowledge","","8","","50","IEEE","7 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, such as transfer, multitask, and layered learning, seek to replicate these abilities. However, humans must specify the task order, which is often difficult particularly with uncertain domain knowledge. This work introduces a continual-learning system (ConCS), such that given an open-ended set of problems once each is solved its solution can contribute to solving further problems. The hypothesis is that the evolutionary computation approach of learning classifier systems (LCSs) can form this system due to its niched, cooperative rules. A collaboration of parallel LCSs identifies sets of patterns linking features to classes that can be reused in related problems automatically. Results from distinct Boolean and integer classification problems, with varying interrelations, show that by combining knowledge from simple problems, complex problems can be solved at increasing scales. 100% accuracy is achieved for the problems tested regardless of the order of task presentation. This includes intractable problems for previous approaches, e.g.,  $n$ -bit Majority-on. A major contribution is that human guidance is now unnecessary to determine the task learning order. Furthermore, the system automatically generates the curricula for learning the most difficult tasks.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3210872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9910346","Building blocks;code fragment (CF);continual learning;learning classifier systems (LCS);multitask learning (MTL)","Task analysis;Artificial intelligence;Multiplexing;Learning systems;Search problems;Scalability;Problem-solving","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","artificial intelligence;complex problems;ConCS;continual learning;cooperative rules;evolutionary computation approach;human guidance;human intelligence;integer classification problems;intractable problems;learning classifier system;multiple Boolean problems;open-ended set;parallel LCSs;task learning order;task order;task presentation;uncertain domain knowledge","","1","","63","CCBY","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, it is highly challenging to design an efficient model management strategy for surrogate-assisted expensive multi-/many-objective optimization. In this article, a surrogate model is built for each objective function, based on which a set of promising candidate solutions are found. Additionally, a Gaussian process model is constructed to approximate a newly designed performance indicator measuring both convergence and diversity properties of individual solutions. Finally, the solution of the found candidate solutions having the maximum expected improvement in terms of the performance indicator is selected for evaluation using the expensive objective functions. Comparative experiments are conducted on 3-, 5-, and 10-objective DTLZ, WFG, and MaF test functions, as well as two real-world applications.

In the framework, a tumor-triggered biological gradient field (BGF) guides the swarm-intelligence-assisted targeting process, where externally manipulable and trackable magnetic nanorobots act as computational agents for the optimization procedure. As BGF can be viewed as an objective function which is utilized to define the fitness landscape for the agents, the inherent attributes of BGF are critical to the IVC process. All our previous investigations are based on the hypothesis that the BGF landscape remains time invariant during the tumor-targeting process, which results in a static function optimization problem. However, the properties of internal environment, such as the flow state of body fluid, will naturally lead to time-dependent variation of BGF, which means that the targeting process should be modeled as a dynamic function optimization problem. Based on this consideration, we focus on dynamic IVC by considering different variation patterns of BGF in this article. Two computational intelligence strategies named “swarm-based learning” and “individual-based learning” are proposed for dealing with the turbulence of the fitness estimation caused by the BGF variation. The in silico experiments and statistical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. In addition, the above process is conducted in a 3-D search space, where the tumor vascular network is generated by an invasion percolation algorithm, which is more realistic compared to the 2-D search space in our previous works.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3198086","Special Science Foundation of Quzhou(grant numbers:2021D014); Hong Kong Scholars Program(grant numbers:XJ2021007); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102071,62071101,62171106); Research Foundation of Artificial Intelligence Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2021RYJ05); Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2022NSFSC0873); Sichuan Science and Technology Planning Project(grant numbers:2021JDRC0036); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9854916","Dynamic optimization;evolution strategy;in vivo computation (IVC);magnetic nanorobots;swarm intelligence (SI);tumor targeting","Tumors;Nanobioscience;In vivo;Optimization;Nanoscale devices;Target tracking;Magnetic resonance imaging","biological tissues;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;medical robotics;multi-agent systems;nanotechnology;optimisation;percolation;robot vision;search problems;stereo image processing;swarm intelligence;tumours","3D search space;computational agents;computational intelligence strategies;dynamic function optimization problem;dynamic in vivo computation;dynamic IVC;early tumor sensing problem;individual-based learning;invasion percolation algorithm;IVC process;learning-based nanobiosensing;magnetic nanorobots act;static function optimization problem;swarm-based learning;swarm-intelligence-assisted targeting process;time-dependent variation;time-varying biological landscapes;tumor vascular network;tumor-targeting process;tumor-triggered BGF;tumor-triggered biological gradient field","","","","54","IEEE","11 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed algorithm uses the speciation mechanism to induce niches preserving more feasible Pareto-optimal solutions and adopts an improved environment selection criterion to enhance diversity. The algorithm can not only obtain feasible solutions but also retain more well-distributed feasible Pareto-optimal solutions.

However, due to mainly the uneven class distribution, constructed classifiers are usually biased toward the majority class, and thereby perform terribly on the minority class. Unfortunately, the minority class is often the class of interest in many real-world applications. High dimensionality often further degrades the classification performance, making it more complicated to address the class imbalance issue. Genetic programming (GP) has been applied to construct classifiers, which can simultaneously select good-quality features to improve the classification performance. To handle the class imbalance issue, cost-sensitive GP classifiers treat the minority class as being more important than the majority class, but this may cause an accuracy decrease in overlapping areas where the prior probabilities of the two classes are almost the same. To date, most cost-sensitive classification methods have not been specifically investigated how the impacts of overlapping areas on cost-sensitive classifiers can be avoided. In this study, we propose a new cost-sensitive GP method, where rough set theory is employed to detect overlapping areas before training cost-sensitive classifiers for classification with unbalanced high-dimensional data. The proposed method is compared with 46 popular classification methods, including 10 GP methods and 36 non-GP methods on 14 datasets that are unbalanced and high dimensional. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method performs better than the compared methods in almost all cases.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3203862","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021ZD0112400); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61906032,61876169,51975294); National Natural Science Foundation of China for Young Scholars(grant numbers:62206041); NSFC-Liaoning Province United Foundation(grant numbers:U1908214); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:DUT22RC(3)015,DUT21TD107); Marsden Fund of New Zealand government(grant numbers:VUW1913,VUW1914); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge (SfTI) fund(grant numbers:E3603/2903); University Research Fund at Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:223805/3986); Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) Data Science the Strategic Science Investment Fund (SSIF)(grant numbers:RTVU1914); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9874858","Class overlap;genetic programming (GP);high dimensionality;rough sets;unbalanced classification","Costs;Task analysis;Training;Support vector machines;Sampling methods;Genetic programming;Rough sets","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;rough set theory","class imbalance issue;classification performance;construct classifiers;cost-sensitive classification methods;cost-sensitive GP classifiers;cost-sensitive GP method;genetic programming;majority class;minority class;neighborhood rough set;rough set theory;unbalanced classification;unbalanced high-dimensional data;uneven class distribution","","","","56","IEEE","1 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When the number of examined solutions is huge, we must prespecify the archive size. In this study, we examine the effects of the archive size on three aspects: 1) the quality of the selected final solution set; 2) the total computation time for the archive maintenance and the final solution set selection; and 3) the required memory size. Unsurprisingly, the increase of the archive size improves the final solution set quality. Interestingly, the total computation time of a medium-size archive is much larger than that of a small-size archive and a huge-size archive (e.g., an unbounded archive). To decrease the computation time, we examine two ideas: 1) periodical archive update and 2) archiving only in later generations. Compared with updating the archive at every generation, the first idea can obtain almost the same final solution set quality using a much shorter computation time at the cost of a slight increase of the memory size. The second idea drastically decreases the computation time at the cost of a slight deterioration of the final solution set quality.
