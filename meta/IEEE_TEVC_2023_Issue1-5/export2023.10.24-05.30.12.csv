The environment of DTPs changes not only over time but also depends on the previous applied solutions. DTPs are hardly solved by existing dynamic evolutionary algorithms because they ignore the time-linkage property. In fact, they can be viewed as multiple decision-making problems and solved by reinforcement learning (RL). However, only some discrete DTPs are solved by RL-based evolutionary optimization algorithms with the assumption of observable objective functions. In this work, we propose a dynamic evolutionary optimization algorithm using surrogate-assisted  $Q$ -learning for continuous black-box DTPs. To observe the states of black-box DTPs, the state extraction and prediction methods are applied after the search process at each time step. Based on the learned information, a surrogate-assisted  $Q$ -learning is introduced to evaluate and select candidate solutions in the continuous decision space in a long-term consideration. We evaluate the components of our proposed algorithm on various benchmark problems to study their behaviors. Results of comparative experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other compared algorithms and performs robustly on DTPs with up to 30 decision variables and different dynamic changes.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3179256","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976165); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); Alexander von Humboldt Professorship for Artificial Intelligence; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785637","Black-box problem;dynamic time-linkage optimization problem (DTP);evolutionary dynamic optimization (EDO);Q-learning;surrogate model","Optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Q-learning;Heuristic algorithms;Convergence;Prediction algorithms","decision making;evolutionary computation;optimisation;reinforcement learning","applied solutions;benchmark problems;black-box DTP;black-box dynamic time-linkage optimization problems;discrete DTP;dynamic changes;dynamic evolutionary algorithms;dynamic evolutionary optimization algorithm;learned information;multiple decision-making problems;reinforcement learning;RL-based evolutionary optimization algorithms;special dynamic optimization problems;surrogate-assisted EvolutionaryQ-learning;surrogate-assistedQ-learning;time-linkage property","","","","60","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To deal with such problems, objective space normalization is widely used in the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) design, especially, in the design of decomposition-based MOEAs. It has been demonstrated that uniformly distributed solutions can be obtained for badly scaled MOPs by decomposition-based MOEAs with objective space normalization. Recently, weight vector scaling has also been used for badly scaled MOPs. In some studies, it was argued that weight vector scaling and objective space normalization are essentially the same when applied to decomposition-based MOEAs. In this article, we theoretically and empirically show the relation between objective space normalization and weight vector scaling. Our results demonstrate that similarities and differences between the two methods depend on the choice of a scalarizing function. How the choice between normalization and weight vector scaling affects decomposition-based MOEAs with solution assignment mechanisms is also analyzed.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3192100","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876075,62002152); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); The Stable Support Plan Program of Shenzhen Natural Science Fund(grant numbers:20200925174447003); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); National Research Foundation Singapore under its AI Singapore Programme(grant numbers:AISG-RP-2018-004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9832650","Decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA);evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO);objective space normalization;weight vector adjustment;weight vector scaling","Statistics;Sociology;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Estimation;Water resources;Upper bound","evolutionary computation;optimisation;vectors","badly scaled MOPs;decomposition-based MOEAs;decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;MOPs;objective space normalization;real-world multiobjective optimization problems;scalarizing function;weight vector scaling","","","","46","IEEE","18 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In theory, generating a large number of offspring for GP, known as brood recombination, can improve its heuristic generation ability. However, it is time consuming to evaluate extra individuals. Phenotypic characterization-based surrogates with K-nearest neighbors have been successfully used for GP to preselect only promising individuals for real fitness evaluations in dynamic JSS. However, sample individuals used by surrogate are from only the current generation, since the fitness of individuals across generations is not comparable due to the rotation of training instances. The surrogate cannot accurately estimate the fitness of an offspring that is far away from all the limited sample individuals at the current generation. This article proposes an effective instance-rotation-based surrogate to address the above issue. Specifically, the surrogate uses the samples extracted from individuals across multiple generations with different instances. More importantly, we propose a fitness mapping strategy to make the fitness evaluated by different instances comparable. The results show that the GP with brood recombination and the proposed surrogate can significantly improve the quality of scheduling heuristics. The results also reveal that the proposed algorithm has successfully reduced the number of omitted promising offspring due to the higher accuracy of the surrogate. The samples in the new surrogate spread better in the phenotypic space, and the nearest neighbor tends to be closer to the predicted offspring. This makes the estimated fitness more accurate.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3180693","Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:MFP-VUW1913,VUW1614); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge Fund(grant numbers:2019-S7-CRS); MBIE SSIF Fund(grant numbers:VUW RTVU1914); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9789507","Brood recombination;dynamic job-shop scheduling (JSS);genetic programming (GP);instance rotation;surrogate","Dynamic scheduling;Job shop scheduling;Training;Sequential analysis;Routing;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization","estimation theory;genetic algorithms;job shop scheduling","brood recombination;dynamic job-shop scheduling;dynamic JSS;fitness estimation;fitness evaluations;fitness mapping;genetic programming;GP;heuristic generation;instance-rotation-based surrogate;offspring;phenotypic characterization;scheduling heuristics","","5","","67","IEEE","7 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, this article proposes a multistage CMOEA and applies this priority, which can save computing resources while helping the algorithm converge. The proposed algorithm completely abandons the feasibility in the early stage to better explore the objective space, and obtains the priority of constraints according to the relationship. Then, the algorithm evaluates a single constraint in the medium stage to further explore the objective space according to this priority, and abandons the evaluation of some less important constraints according to the relationship to save the evaluation times. At the end stage of the algorithm, the feasibility will be fully considered to improve the quality of the solutions obtained in the first two stages, and finally get the solutions with good convergence, feasibility, and diversity.

Traditionally, this problem is formulated as an offline optimization problem, whose solutions are, however, impractical for most real-world scenarios primarily because of the uncertainties of dynamic events in both yard operations and seaside loading–unloading operations. These solutions are either unattractive or infeasible to execute. Herein, for more intelligent handling of these uncertainties and dynamics, a novel cooperative double-layer genetic programming hyper-heuristic (CD-GPHH) is proposed to tackle this challenging online optimization problem. In this new CD-GPHH, a novel scenario genetic programming (GP) approach is added on top of a traditional GP method that chooses among different GP heuristics for different scenarios to facilitate optimized truck dispatching. In contrast to traditional arithmetic GP (AGP) and GP with logic operators (LGP) which only evolve on one population, our CD-GPHH method separates the scenario and the calculation into two populations, which improved the quality of solutions in multiscenario problems while reducing the search space. Experimental results show that our CD-GPHH dominates AGP and LGP in solving a multiscenario function fitting problem as well as a truck dispatching problem in a container terminal.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3209985","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72071116); Ningbo Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2019B10026); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9903916","Container port;cooperative algorithm;genetic programming (GP);hyper-heuristic;online truck dispatching","Containers;Dispatching;Seaports;Optimization;Uncertainty;Task analysis;Heuristic algorithms","dispatching;genetic algorithms;optimisation;sea ports;search problems","CD-GPHH method;challenging online optimization problem;different GP heuristics;double-layer genetic programming hyper-heuristic;logic operators;marine container terminal;multiscenario function fitting problem;multiscenario problems;novel scenario genetic programming approach;offline optimization problem;online container terminal truck dispatching;operation efficiency;optimized truck dispatching;seaside loading-unloading operations;traditional arithmetic GP;traditional GP method;truck dispatching problem;yard operations","","2","","59","IEEE","27 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An optimization problem involving interval parameters and multiple conflicting objectives is termed as a multiobjective optimization problem with interval parameters (IMOP). Few studies have addressed IMOPs compared to deterministic multiobjective optimization at present. In addition, the uncertainty involved in the problems raises higher demands on the diversity and efficiency of an algorithm. Therefore, an adaptive reference vector-based interval multiobjective evolutionary algorithm in the framework of MOEA/D (IMOEA/D) was proposed in this article. First, an IMOP is decomposed into a number of subproblems with interval parameters by setting an interval-valued reference point and constructing interval-valued scalar functions. Following that, an ensemble scheme for evaluating interval individuals is developed via the rank sum ratio method. Finally, reference vectors are adaptively adjusted based on the interval crowding distance to enhance the distribution of a population. The proposed IMOEA/D was tested on 20 benchmark IMOPs as well as a scheduling problem of underwater wireless sensor networks, and compared with four state-of-the-art interval MOEAs. The empirical results demonstrate its superior performance and strong competitiveness.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3193294","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFE0199000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61873105,62133015,12105120,72174079); Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province of China; 521 Talents Project of Lianyungang of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9837305","Evolutionary algorithm (EA);interval parameter;interval-valued scalar function;multiobjective optimization problem (MOP);reference vector","Optimization;Uncertainty;Statistics;Sociology;Linear programming;Evolutionary computation;Portfolios","evolutionary computation;optimisation;Pareto optimisation;wireless sensor networks","adaptive reference vector-based interval multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;constructing interval-valued scalar functions;deterministic multiobjective optimization;IMOP;interval crowding distance;interval individuals;interval parameters;interval-valued reference point;multiobjective optimization problem;real-world optimization problems;reference vectors;state-of-the-art interval MOEAs","","3","","43","IEEE","22 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both strategies can counteract the disruptive effect of noise; however, a critical question remains: which one is more efficient? This question has been raised in many studies, with conflicting preferences and, in some cases, findings. Nevertheless, theoretical findings on the noisy sphere problem with additive Gaussian noise supports the superiority of implicit averaging, which may have had a strong impact on the preference of implicit averaging in more recent evolutionary methods for noisy optimization. This study speculates that the analytically supported superiority of implicit averaging relies on specific features of the noisy sphere problem with additive noise, which cannot be generalized to other problems. It enumerates these features and designs controlled numerical experiments to investigate this potential reliance. Each experiment gradually suppresses one specific feature, and the progress rate is numerically calculated for different values of the sample size given a fixed evaluation budget. Our empirical results indicate that for a wide range of noise strength and evaluation budget per iteration, the more these specific features are suppressed, the more the optimal averaging strategy deviates from implicit toward explicit averaging, which confirms our speculations. Consequently, the optimal sample size, which is regarded as the tradeoff between implicit and explicit averaging, depends on the problem characteristics and should be learned during optimization for maximum efficiency.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3201090","Australian Research Council Discovery Project(grant numbers:DP190102637); CONACyT (Investigación en Fronteras de la Ciencia 2016)(grant numbers:2016-01-1920); SEP-Cinvestav Grant (application no. 4); Basque Government through the BERC 2022–2025 Program; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities: BCAM Severo Ochoa Accreditation(grant numbers:SEV-2017-0718); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9866832","Continuous optimization;evolutionary algorithm;noisy problem;uncertainty","Optimization;Noise measurement;Statistics;Sociology;Uncertainty;Standards;Signal to noise ratio","evolutionary computation;Gaussian noise;optimisation;sampling methods","additive Gaussian noise;evolutionary method;explicit averaging;implicit averaging;noise strength;noisy optimization;noisy sphere problem;optimal averaging strategy;optimal sample size","","","","41","IEEE","25 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, neural architecture search (NAS) methods have been proposed to automate the process of network architecture design, many of which have discovered novel CNN architectures that are superior to human-designed ones. However, most of the current NAS methods suffer from either prohibitively high computational complexity of resulting architectures which have inadvertently affected the deep model deployment, or limitations which impede the flexibility of architecture design. To address these deficiencies, this work proposes an evolutionary computation (EC)-based method for compact and flexible NAS. A valuable search space with parameter-efficient mobile-inverted bottleneck convolution blocks as the primitive components is proposed to ensure the initial quality of the compact architectures.

For convergence, the BS method is applied to each population of the MPMO framework to enhance the role of nondominated sorting by biasedly paying more attention to the objective optimized by the corresponding population. This way, all the populations in the MPMO framework evolve together to promote the convergence performance on all objectives of the MaOP. For diversity, an elite learning strategy is adopted to generate locally mutated solutions, and a reference vector-based maintenance method is adopted to preserve diverse solutions.

Currently, the computational resource allocation schemes of most CC could be divided into two categories, namely, equal allocation to all subproblems and preference allocation to the subproblems with a large contribution. However, the difficult subproblems are not carefully considered by the existing computational resource allocation schemes. For these subproblems, the investment of computational resources cannot quickly improve the fitness value, which leads to their small early contribution and being neglected. In this article, we comprehensively analyze the imbalanced nature of the subproblems from their difficulty and contribution in LSOPs. First, we propose a method to quantify the optimization difficulty of the problems during the evolution process, which considers both the difficulty of the fitness landscape and the behaviors of the optimization algorithm. Then, we propose a novel both difficulty and contribution-based CC framework, called DCCC, which encourages the allocation of the computational resources to more contributing and more difficult subproblems. DCCC is tested on the CEC’2010 and CEC’2013 large-scale optimization benchmarks, and is compared with several typical CC frameworks and state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms.

That is, they have difficulty optimizing too many objective functions, are ineffective in maintaining population diversity, or are challenged in establishing appropriate additional objective functions. As a remedy to these limitations, we propose a novel technique called NRC for handling CMOPs. The novelty of NRC lies in its three sorting procedures: 1) nondominated sorting; 2) reversed nondominated sorting; and 3) constrained crowding distance sorting, which are performed in sequence to provide driving forces toward the Pareto front (PF) of a transformed unconstrained multiobjective optimization problem (treating the overall constraint violation as an additional objective function), the boundary front, and the constrained PF, respectively. With the combination of these three different forces, NRC can conveniently approach the desired PF from diverse search directions. The effectiveness of NRC is experimentally verified. Also, we incorporate NRC into a two-archive mechanism and develop a novel constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, called NRC2. Comprehensive experiments on 49 benchmark CMOPs and 21 real-world ones demonstrate that NRC2 is significantly superior or comparable to six state-of-the-art constrained evolutionary multiobjective optimizers on most test instances.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3194729","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61966012,62206090,61860206011,62106099); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022M711112); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB2104000); Academician Innovation Program of Hainan Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9851574","Evolutionary constrained multiobjective optimization;multiobjective-based constraint-handling technique (CHT);reversed nondominated sorting;two-archive mechanism","Optimization;Linear programming;Sorting;Pareto optimization;Standards;Statistics;Sociology","constraint handling;evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation;sorting","CMOPs;constrained crowding distance sorting;constrained multiobjective optimization problems;diverse search directions;evolutionary constrained multiobjective optimization;evolutionary constrained single-objective optimization;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective-based constraint-handling technique;nondominated sorting;NRC2;Pareto front;reversed nondominated sorting;transformed unconstrained multiobjective optimization problem","","1","","61","IEEE","5 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We initiate theoretical research of the W-model by studying how one of its properties—neutrality—influences the run time of random local search (RLS). Neutrality creates plateaus in the search space by first performing a majority vote for subsets of the solution candidate and then evaluating the smaller dimensional string via a low-level fitness function. We prove upper bounds for the expected run time of RLS on this  $\mathrm{M{\scriptstyle AJORITY}}$  problem for its entire parameter spectrum. To this end, we provide a theorem, applicable to many optimization algorithms, that links the run time of  $\mathrm{M{\scriptstyle AJORITY}}$  with its symmetric version  $\mathrm{H{\scriptstyle AS}M{\scriptstyle AJORITY}}$ , where a sufficient majority is needed to optimize the subset.

However, special points may be impacted by certain individuals with a large direction deviation, and thus, mislead the tracking of dynamic POS. To solve this issue, a correlation-guided layered prediction approach for solving DMOPs is proposed in this article, where multiple prediction models are integrated by considering the correlation of individuals’ moving directions. To be specific, the population is clustered into three subpopulations (i.e., high, mid, and low correlation) by correlation analysis to perform different prediction behaviors. The high correlation subpopulation aims to predict the moving direction via a linear prediction model. The mid correlation subpopulation is devoted to predicting the manifold change of POS by self-adaptively using the direction and length correction models. The diversity preservation is considered by the low correlation subpopulation. While the three subpopulations focus on different optimization tasks, they also cooperate to track the dynamic POS. The comprehensive experimental results on a variety of benchmark test problems demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, as compared with some state-of-the-art prediction-based dynamic multiobjective algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3193287","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62176238,61806179,61876169,61976237); National Natural Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars of China(grant numbers:61922072); Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province(grant numbers:222300420088); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M682347,2022M712878); Training Program of Young Backbone Teachers in Colleges and Universities in Henan Province(grant numbers:2020GGJS006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9837296","Correction model;correlation;evolutionary dynamic multiobjective optimization;prediction;self-adaptively selection","Correlation;Sociology;Predictive models;Optimization;Manifolds;Task analysis;Prediction algorithms","correlation methods;evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation","correlation analysis;correlation-guided layered prediction approach;direction correction model;dynamic Pareto-optimal solution tracking;dynamic POS tracking;evolutionary algorithms;evolutionary DMOPs;evolutionary dynamic multiobjective optimization problems;historical moving directions;length correction model;linear prediction model;Pareto front","","23","","53","IEEE","22 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We use the MA as the baseline algorithm and incorporate the neighborhood strategy to maintain the population diversity. In addition, we design a novel regression partition initialization and adaptive parameter control to enhance our algorithm, and propose the concept of the redundant individual to improve the search efficiency.

To do this, we extend recent work on Landscape Analysis features for characterizing CMOPs. Specifically, we introduce new features to describe the multiobjective-violation landscape, formed by the interaction between constraint violation and multiobjective fitness. The detailed evaluation of the algorithm footprints, spanning eight CMOP benchmark suites and 15 CMOEAs, demonstrates that ISA effectively captures the strength and weakness of the CMOEAs. We conclude that two characteristics, the isolation of nondominate set and the correlation between constraints and objectives evolvability, have the greatest impact on algorithm performance.

Both are likely to occur on complicated multimodal functions, but the phenomena differ. Premature convergence refers to a rapid loss of population diversity when attracted to a local minimum while stagnation happens even though the population is diverse. To deal with these problems, this article proposes a domain transform (DT) methodology. Different from existing fitness analysis which mainly utilizes the original fitness landscape information, DT yields a transformed fitness landscape with transform operation to the frequency domain and inverse transform operation back to the solution domain, between which the first few highest frequencies are removed. With the deletion operation, the transformed fitness landscape becomes smoother and facilitates the escape from local minima and stagnation on complicated multimodal functions. Simulation results show that DT significantly improves the population successful update rate and population convergence. The constructed DTDE algorithm consequently exhibits remarkable improvements on the baseline algorithm and outperforms several state-of-the-art DE variants. DT has also been extended for noisy optimization and it performs better than the baseline, the classic resampling method, state-of-the-art DE variants, as well as several popular noisy evolutionary optimization algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3220424","Applied Science and Technology Research and Development Special Fund Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2016B010126004); National Special Project Number for International Cooperation(grant numbers:2015DFR11050); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62201227,62071503); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9941343","Differential evolution (DE);domain transform (DT);evolutionary optimization;fitness landscape;noisy optimization","Statistics;Sociology;Optimization;Noise measurement;Convergence;Transforms;Search problems","convergence;evolutionary computation;inverse transforms;optimisation","deletion operation;differential evolution;domain transform;DTDE algorithm;evolutionary optimization algorithm;fitness analysis;fitness landscape information;fitness landscape transformation;frequency domain;global optimization;inverse transform operation;multimodal function;population convergence;population diversity;population successful update rate;premature convergence;solution domain","","4","","93","IEEE","8 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This means that the approximated set should be as close to the PF as possible, and as diverse as possible. The former is usually called a convergence criterion and the latter is called a diversity criterion. A variety of strategies have been proposed to meet the two criteria. However, as far as the diversity criterion is concerned, it is still a challenge to achieve an evenly distributed approximation set with different sizes for a problem with a complicated PF shape. To deal with this challenge, we propose a local subset selection (LSS) -based environmental selection for evolutionary multiobjective optimization in this article. LSS considers the environmental selection as a subset selection problem by choosing promising solutions from the combination of the parent and offspring populations. In LSS, a potential energy function is utilized as the objective function, which provides a heavy selection pressure on diversity as well as has low computational complexity. Furthermore, to balance search efficiency and quality, a local search strategy is used in LSS to make full use of objective information for acceleration. The proposed LSS strategy is embedded into some state-of-the-art Pareto-domination-based MOEAs, and the experimental results suggest that LSS can produce shape-invariant and evenly distributed nondominated sets with different population sizes.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3194211","Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:19511120601); Scientific and Technological Innovation 2030 Major Projects(grant numbers:2018AAA0100902); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61731009,61907015); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9843885","Evolutionary algorithm;local search;multiobjective optimization;potential energy function;subset selection","Optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Potential energy;Search problems;Sorting;Approximation algorithms","computational complexity;evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation;search problems","approximated set;complicated PF shape;convergence criterion;diversity criterion;environmental selection;evenly distributed approximation set;evenly distributed nondominated solutions;evolutionary multiobjective optimization;heavy selection pressure;local search strategy;local subset selection;LSS strategy;MOP;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;multiobjective optimization problem;nondominated sets;state-of-the-art Pareto-domination-based MOEA;subset selection problem","","","","52","IEEE","27 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main idea of MOEA/D is that the objectives are weighted through different vectors to form different subproblems, and an optimal solution set is obtained by co-evolution in a certain neighborhood. However, with the increase of objectives, the number of nondominated solutions increases exponentially, resulting in the deteriorated capability of searching for optimal solutions. In addition, for an optimization problem with the complex Pareto front (PF), the selection pressure of nondominated solutions is insufficient. To make evolution more efficient, an MOEA/D with adaptively adjusting weight vectors and neighborhoods (MOEA/D-AAWNs) is developed in this article. First, the evolutionary direction of each subproblem is analyzed and the Sparsity function (Spa) is proposed to measure the population density on the PF. By using Spa, a method of generating uniform vectors is presented to improve the diversity of solutions. Besides, a method of adaptively adjusting neighborhoods is given. It adjusts neighborhoods according to the number of iterations and the Spa value of its corresponding subproblem. In this way, the computational resource can be effectively allocated, leading to the improvement in evolutionary efficiency. The proposed algorithm is applied to solve a series of benchmark optimization instances, and the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms comparison algorithms in runtime, convergence, and diversity.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3201890","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2020ZDPYMS40); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9868079","Adaptive mechanism;decomposition-based multiobjective optimization algorithm (MOEA/D);neighborhood adjustment;weight vector","Optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Linear programming;Convergence;Search problems;Runtime","evolutionary computation;iterative methods;Pareto optimisation;vectors","adaptively adjusting weight vector and neighborhoods;benchmark optimization instances;complex Pareto front;computational resource;decomposition-based multiobjective optimization algorithm;evolutionary efficiency;MOEA/D;MOEA/D-AAWNs;MOP;nondominated solutions;optimal solution set;population density;Spa value;sparsity function;uniform vectors","","","","42","IEEE","26 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In black-box optimization, the dependencies between decision variables remain unknown. However, some techniques can discover such interactions accurately. In large-scale global optimization (LSGO), problems are high dimensional. It was shown effective to decompose LSGO problems into subproblems and optimize them separately. The effectiveness of such approaches may be highly dependent on the accuracy of problem decomposition. Many state-of-the-art decomposition strategies are derived from differential grouping (DG). However, if a given problem consists of nonadditively separable subproblems, DG-based strategies may discover many nonexisting interactions. On the other hand, monotonicity checking strategies proposed so far do not report nonexisting interactions for any separable subproblems but may miss discovering many of the existing ones. Therefore, we propose incremental recursive ranking grouping (IRRG) that suffers from none of these flaws. IRRG consumes more fitness function evaluations than the recent DG-based propositions, e.g., recursive DG 3 (RDG3). Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the considered cooperative co-evolution frameworks after embedding IRRG or RDG3 was similar for problems with additively separable subproblems that are suitable for RDG3. After replacing the additive separability with nonadditive, embedding IRRG leads to results of significantly higher quality.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3216968","Polish National Science Centre (NCN)(grant numbers:2020/38/E/ST6/00370); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9929256","Large-scale global optimization (LSGO);monotonicity checking;nonadditive separability;problem decomposition","Optimization;Couplings;Costs;Additives;Space exploration;Complexity theory;Time complexity","evolutionary computation;optimisation","black-box optimization;cooperative co-evolution frameworks;decomposition strategies;DG-based strategies;differential grouping;fitness function evaluations;incremental recursive ranking grouping;IRRG;large-scale global optimization;LSGO problems;monotonicity checking strategies;real-world optimization problems","","3","","49","CCBY","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two significant issues in solving MaTOPs are measuring intertask similarity and transferring knowledge among similar tasks. However, most existing algorithms only use a single similarity measurement, which cannot accurately measure the intertask similarity because the intertask similarity is a concept with multiple different aspects. To address this limitation, this article proposes a bi-objective knowledge transfer (BoKT) framework, which aims first to accurately measure different types of intertask similarity using two different measurements and second to effectively transfer knowledge with different types of similarity via specific strategies. To achieve the first goal, a bi-objective measurement is designed to measure intertask similarity from two different aspects, including shape similarity and domain similarity. To achieve the second goal, a similarity-based adaptive knowledge transfer strategy is designed to choose the suitable knowledge transfer strategy based on the type of intertask similarity. We compare the BoKT framework-based algorithms with several state-of-the-art algorithms on two challenging many-task optimization test suites with 16 instances and on real-world MaTOPs with up to 500 tasks.

Part of this interest is supported by its application to cutting-edge research, such as Deep Learning, Big Data, and complex real-world problems, such as image encryption, real-time traffic management, and more. However, the high dimensionality makes solving LSGO a significant challenge. Some recent research deal with the high dimensionality by mapping the optimization process to a reduced alternative space. Nonetheless, these works suffer from the changes in the search space topology and the loss of information caused by the dimensionality reduction. This article proposes a hybrid metaheuristic, so-called low-dimensional space modeling-based differential evolution (LSMDE), that uses the singular value decomposition to build a low-dimensional search space from the features of candidate solutions generated by a new SHADE-based algorithm (GM-SHADE). GM-SHADE combines a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and two specialized local algorithms: 1) MTS-LS1 and 2) L-BFGS-B, to promote a better exploration of the reduced search space. GMM mitigates the loss of information in mapping high-dimensional individuals to low-dimensional individuals. Furthermore, the proposal does not require prior knowledge of the search space topology, which makes it more flexible and adaptable to different LSGO problems. The results indicate that LSMDE is the most efficient method to deal with partially separable functions compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms and has the best overall performance in two of the three proposed experiments. Experimental results also show that the new approach achieves competitive results for nonseparable and overlapping functions on the most recent test suite for LSGO problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3227440","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES), Brazil—Finance(grant numbers:001); Research Grant from Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)(grant numbers:SFI/16/RC/3918 (CONFIRM)); Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant(grant numbers:847.577); European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9973396","Differential evolution (DE);dimensionality reduction;Gaussian mixture model (GMM);singular value decomposition (SVD)","Optimization;Search problems;Statistics;Heuristic algorithms;Sociology;Dimensionality reduction;Clustering algorithms","","","","1","","68","IEEE","7 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To solve such problems within a limited number of solution evaluations, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are often used. However, existing SAEAs typically operate in a generational framework wherein multiple solutions are identified for evaluation in each generation. There exist relatively few proposals in steady-state framework, wherein only a single solution is evaluated in each iteration. The development of such algorithms is crucial to efficiently solve EMOPs for which the evaluation of candidate designs cannot be parallelized. Furthermore, regardless of the framework used, the performance of current SAEAs tends to degrade when the Pareto front (PF) of the problem has irregularities, such as extremely concave/convex segments, even for 2/3-objective problems. To contextualize the motivation of this study, the performance of a few state-of-the-art SAEAs is first demonstrated on some such selected problems. Then, to address the above research gaps, we propose a surrogate-assisted steady-state EA (SASSEA), which incorporates a number of novel elements, including: 1) effective use of model uncertainty information to aid the search, including the use of the probabilistic dominance and Mahalanobis distance; 2) two-step infill identification using nondominance (ND) and distance-based selection; and 3) a shadow ND mechanism to avoid repeated selection and evaluation of dominated solutions. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive benchmarking on a range of test problems. It shows competitive performance relative to many state-of-the-art SAEAs, including both steady-state and generational approaches.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3219062","Tuition Fee Scholarship (TFS) from The University of New South Wales; Australian Research Council through Discovery Project(grant numbers:DP220101649); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937144","Infill strategy;multiobjective algorithm;steady-state algorithm;surrogate-assisted optimization","Steady-state;Optimization;Approximation algorithms;Uncertainty;Shape;Convergence;Classification algorithms","evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation;probability","2/3-objective problems;concave segments;convex segments;distance-based selection;EMOPs;expensive multiobjective optimization problems;generational approaches;Mahalanobis distance;model uncertainty information;nondominance;nonparallelizable evaluations;Pareto front;PF;probabilistic dominance;SASSEA;shadow ND mechanism;solution evaluations;steady-state algorithm;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms;surrogate-assisted steady-state EA;two-step infill identification","","1","","60","IEEE","3 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
