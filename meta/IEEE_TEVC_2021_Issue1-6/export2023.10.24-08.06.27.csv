"A Duplication Analysis-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Biobjective Feature Selection","H. Xu; B. Xue; M. Zhang","School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand","IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","30 Mar 2021","2021","25","2","205","218","Feature selection is a complex optimization problem with important real-world applications. Normally, its main target is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and increase the effectiveness of the classification. Owing to the population-inspired characteristics, different evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been proposed to solve feature selection problems over the past decades. However, the majority of them only consider single-objective optimization while many real-world problems have multiple objectives, which creates a genuine demand for designing more suitable and effective EAs to handle multiobjective feature selection. A multiobjective feature selection problem usually consists of two objectives: one is to minimize the number of selected features and the other is to minimize the error of classification. In this article, we propose a duplication analysis-based EA (DAEA) for biobjective feature selection in classification. In the proposed algorithm, we make improvements on the basic dominance-based EA framework in three aspects: first, the reproduction process is modified to improve the quality of offspring; second, a duplication analysis method is proposed to filter out the redundant solutions; and third, a diversity-based selection method is adopted to further select the reserved solutions. In the experiments, we have compared the proposed algorithm with five state-of-the-art multiobjective EAs (MOEAs) and tested them on 20 classification datasets, using two widely used performance metrics. According to the empirical results, DAEA performs the best on most datasets, indicating that DAEA not only gains outstanding optimization performance but also obtains good classification and generalization results.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3016049","Marsden Fund of New Zealand(grant numbers:VUW1509,VUW1615); Educational Department Research Project of Fujian Province(grant numbers:JAT190594); University Research Fund of Putian University(grant numbers:2019002); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge Fund(grant numbers:E3603/2903); University Research Fund at Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:216378/3764,223805/3986); MBIE Data Science SSIF Fund(grant numbers:RTVU1914); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876169); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9165863","Classification;duplication analysis;evolutionary algorithm (EA);feature selection;multiobjective optimization","Feature extraction;Optimization;Sociology;Statistics;Evolutionary computation;Measurement;Computer science","evolutionary computation;feature selection;pattern classification","DAEA;MOEAs;dominance-based EA framework;population-inspired characteristics;complex optimization problem;duplication analysis-based evolutionary algorithm;classification datasets;multiobjective EAs;diversity-based selection method;biobjective feature selection;duplication analysis-based EA;multiobjective feature selection problem","","45","","93","IEEE","12 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most existing SAEAs suffer from performance degradation with the dimensionality increasing. To solve this issue, this article proposes a classifier-assisted level-based learning swarm optimizer on the basis of the level-based learning swarm optimizer (LLSO) and the gradient boosting classifier (GBC) to improve the robustness and scalability of SAEAs. Particularly, the level-based learning strategy in LLSO has a tight correspondence with the classification characteristic by setting the number of levels in LLSO to be the same as the number of classes in GBC. Together, the classification results feedback the distribution of promising candidates to accelerate the evolution of the optimizer, while the evolved population helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. To select informative and valuable candidates for real evaluations, we devise an  ${L}1$ -exploitation strategy to extensively exploit promising areas. Then, the candidate selection is conducted between the predicted  ${L}1$  offspring and the already real-evaluated  ${L}1$  individuals based on their Euclidean distances. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark functions demonstrate that the proposed optimizer can achieve competitive or better performance with a very small training dataset compared with three state-of-the-art SAEAs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3017865","Key Project of Science and Technology Innovation 2030; Ministry of Science and Technology of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976093,61876111); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu(grant numbers:SBK2020040136); Brain Pool program; Ministry of Science and ICT through the National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2019H1D3A2A01101977); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9171272","Expensive optimization;gradient boosting classifier (GBC);large-scale optimization;level-based learning swarm optimizer (LLSO);surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (SAEA)","Optimal scheduling;Single machine scheduling;Schedules;Job shop scheduling;Programming","evolutionary computation;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification","L1-exploitation strategy;gradient boosting classifier;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms;classifier-assisted level-based learning swarm optimizer;LLSO;SAEAs;optimization problems","","41","","57","IEEE","19 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet, design problems often have objective functions and constraints that are expensive and highly nonlinear. Combinations of these features lead to poor convergence and diversity loss with common algorithms that have not been specifically designed for constrained optimization. Constrained benchmark problems exist, but they do not necessarily represent the challenges of engineering problems. In this article, a framework to design electro-mechanical actuators, called multiobjective design of actuators (MODAct), is presented and 20 constrained multiobjective optimization test problems are derived from the framework with a specific focus on constraints. The full source code is made available to ease its use. The effects of the constraints are analyzed through their impact on the Pareto front as well as on the convergence performance. A constraint landscape analysis approach is followed and extended with three new metrics to characterize the search and objective spaces. The features of MODAct are compared to existing test suites to highlight the differences. In addition, a convergence analysis using NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and C-TAEA on MODAct and existing test suites suggests that the design problems are indeed difficult due to the constraints. In particular, the number of simultaneously violated constraints in newly generated solutions seems key in understanding the convergence challenges. Thus, MODAct offers an efficient framework to analyze and handle constraints in future optimization algorithm design.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3020046","Innosuisse (the Swiss Innovation Agency); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9179777","Constraint handling;evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective optimization;real-world problems;test suites","Optimization;Benchmark testing;Search problems;Convergence;Measurement;Complexity theory;Linear programming","evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation;search problems","search spaces;C-TAEA;NSGA-III;NSGA-II;Pareto front;multiobjective design of actuators;constrained multiobjective optimization test problems;design electro-mechanical actuators;engineering problems;constrained benchmark problems;diversity loss;objective functions;design tradeoffs;realistic constrained multiobjective optimization benchmark problems;optimization algorithm design;convergence analysis;constraint landscape analysis approach;MODAct","","14","","43","IEEE","28 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based network reconstruction methods have been proposed to address this problem, but they ignore several useful information of network structure, such as community structure, which widely exists in various complex networks. Inspired by the community structure, this article develops a community-based evolutionary multiobjective network reconstruction framework to promote the reconstruction performance of EA-based network reconstruction methods due to their good performance; we refer this framework as CEMO-NR. CEMO-NR is a generic framework and any population-based multiobjective metaheuristic algorithm can be employed as the base optimizer. CEMO-NR employs the community structure of networks to divide the original decision space into multiple small decision spaces, and then any multiobjective EA (MOEA) can be used to search for improved solutions in the reduced decision space. To verify the performance of CEMO-NR, this article also designs a test suite for complex network reconstruction problems. Three representative MOEAs are embedded into CEMO-NR and compared with their original versions, respectively. The experimental results have demonstrated the significant improvement benefiting from the proposed CEMO-NR in 30 multiobjective network reconstruction problems (MONRPs).","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3020423","Key Project of Science and Technology Innovation 2030; Ministry of Science and Technology of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101302); General Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61773300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180296","Community structure;complex network reconstruction;evolutionary algorithm (EA);large-scale optimization;multiobjective optimization","Optimization;Reconstruction algorithms;Complex networks;Data models;Sociology;Statistics;Evolutionary computation","complex networks;evolutionary computation;optimisation;search problems","multiobjective EA;base optimizer;population-based multiobjective metaheuristic algorithm;CEMO-NR;EA-based network reconstruction methods;community-based evolutionary multiobjective network reconstruction framework;complex networks;network structure;evolutionary algorithm-based network reconstruction methods;complex dynamical systems;nonlinear systems;community structure","","8","","62","IEEE","31 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In evolutionary multitasking, the tasks might have biases embedded in function landscapes and decision spaces, which often causes the threat of predominantly negative transfer. However, the complementary information among different tasks can give an enhanced performance of solving complicated problems when properly harnessed. In this article, we distill this insight by introducing an intertask knowledge transfer strategy implemented in the low-dimension subspaces via a learnable alignment matrix. Specifically, to unveil the significant features of the function landscapes, the task-specific low-dimension subspaces is established based on the distribution information of subpopulations possessed by tasks, respectively. Next, the alignment matrix between pairwise subspaces is learned by minimizing the discrepancies of the subspaces. Given the aligned subspaces by applying the alignment matrix to subspaces' base vectors, the individuals from different tasks are then projected into aligned subspaces and reproduce therein. Moreover, since this method only considers the leading eigenvectors, it turns out to be intrinsically regularized and noise-insensitive. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the synthetic and practical benchmark problems so as to assess the efficacy of the proposed method. According to the experimental results, the proposed method exhibits a superior performance compared with existing evolutionary multitask optimization algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3023480","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62036006); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0802200); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2018ZDXM-GY-045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9195010","Evolutionary multitasking (EMT);knowledge transfer;multifactorial optimization (MFO);multitask optimization (MTO);subspace aligning","Task analysis;Optimization;Knowledge transfer;Multitasking;Sociology;Statistics;Benchmark testing","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;optimisation","regularized evolutionary multitask optimization algorithms;eigenvectors;explicit intertask information transfer strategy;task-specific low-dimension subspaces;learnable alignment matrix;intertask knowledge transfer strategy;function landscapes;optimization tasks;aligned subspace;pairwise subspaces","","35","","45","IEEE","11 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Early advancements in CNN architectures are primarily driven by human expertise and by elaborate design processes. Recently, neural architecture search was proposed with the aim of automating the network design process and generating task-dependent architectures. While existing approaches have achieved competitive performance in image classification, they are not well suited to problems where the computational budget is limited for two reasons: 1) the obtained architectures are either solely optimized for classification performance, or only for one deployment scenario and 2) the search process requires vast computational resources in most approaches. To overcome these limitations, we propose an evolutionary algorithm for searching neural architectures under multiple objectives, such as classification performance and floating point operations (FLOPs). The proposed method addresses the first shortcoming by populating a set of architectures to approximate the entire Pareto frontier through genetic operations that recombine and modify architectural components progressively. Our approach improves computational efficiency by carefully down-scaling the architectures during the search as well as reinforcing the patterns commonly shared among past successful architectures through Bayesian model learning. The integration of these two main contributions allows an efficient design of architectures that are competitive and in most cases outperform both manually and automatically designed architectures on benchmark image classification datasets: CIFAR, ImageNet, and human chest X-ray. The flexibility provided from simultaneously obtaining multiple architecture choices for different compute requirements further differentiates our approach from other methods in the literature.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3024708","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:DBI-0939454); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201169","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);evolutionary deep learning;genetic algorithms (GAs);neural architecture search (NAS)","Computer architecture;Optimization;Search problems;Task analysis;Neural networks;Computational modeling;Graphics processing units","Bayes methods;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);evolutionary computation;image classification;neural net architecture","human chest X-ray;ImageNet;CIFAR;Bayesian model learning;FLOP;computational resources;neural architecture;CNN;image classification;floating point operations;evolutionary algorithm;deep convolutional neural networks;multiobjective evolutionary design","","67","","61","IEEE","21 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent years, for many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs), a number of evolutionary algorithms have been developed to search for Pareto optimal solutions. However, there is a lack of research works focusing on designing decision-making approaches. In order to overcome this deficiency, we propose a novel knee-based decision-making method to search for several solutions of interest (SOIs) from a large number of solutions on the Pareto front, each of which contains the best convergence performance at least within its neighborhood and can be identified as a global or local knee solution. The optimization performance achieved by all SOIs approximates the performance of the whole Pareto front as much as possible. Furthermore, in order to relieve the difficulties in the decision-making process on MaOPs, a new visualization approach is developed based on this proposed decision-making approach. It provides information about the shape and location of the Pareto front, the possible bulge, as well as the convergence degree and distribution of solutions.

In our experiments, a (1 + 1)-FEA, the same algorithm but using FFA, exhibits mean runtimes that seem to scale as s2 ln s. Since Jump and Trap are bijective transformations of OneMax, it behaves identical on all three. On OneMax, LeadingOnes, and Plateau problems, it seems to be slower than the (1 + 1)-EA by a factor linear in s. The (1 + 1)-FEA performs much better than the (1 + 1)-EA on W-Model and MaxSat instances.

Although behavioral diversity is traditionally obtained by describing the observed resulting behavior of robot controllers evaluated in a single environment, it is often more easily induced by introducing environmental diversity, i.e., by manipulating the environments in which the controllers are evaluated. This article proposes quality-environment-diversity (QED), an algorithm that repeatedly generates a random environment according to a probability distribution over environmental features (e.g., number of obstacles, arena size and robot sensor and actuator characteristics), evaluates the controller in that environment, and then describes the controller in terms of the features of that environment, the environment descriptor. Our study compares QED to three baseline task-specific and generic behavioral descriptors, in 5 different robot swarm benchmark tasks. For each task, the quality of the evolved archives is assessed by their capability to provide high-performing compensatory behaviors following injection of 250 unique faults to the robots of the swarm. The evolved archives achieve a median 2- to 3-fold reduction in the impact of the faults on the performance of the swarm. A qualitative analysis of evolved archives is done by visualizing the relation between diversity of compensatory behaviors, here called useful behavioral diversity, and fault recovery metrics. The resulting signatures indicate that, due to the diversity of environments inducing useful behavioral diversity, archives evolved by QED provide robot swarm controllers that are capable of recovering from high-impact faults.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3036578","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the New Investigator Award(grant numbers:EP/R030073/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9250603","Behavioral diversity;evolutionary robotics;fault recovery;quality-diversity algorithms;swarm robotics","Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Task analysis;Swarm robotics;Legged locomotion;Actuators","collision avoidance;evolutionary computation;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;statistical distributions","probability distribution;resilient robot swarms;robot swarm controllers;compensatory behaviors;generic behavioral descriptors;environment descriptor;actuator characteristics;robot sensor;random environment;environmental diversity;robot controllers;evolved archives;behavioral diversity metric;quality-diversity algorithms;quality-environment-diversity;QED","","10","","59","IEEE","6 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A core strength is its ability to effectively exploit the linkage structure of a problem, which often is unknown a priori and has to be learned online. Previously published work on RV-GOMEA, however, demonstrated excellent scalability when the linkage structure is prespecified appropriately. A mutual information-based metric to learn linkage structure online, as commonly adopted in EDA's and the original discrete version of the gene-pool optimal mixing evolutionary algorithm, did not lead to similarly excellent results, especially in a black-box setting. In this article, the strengths of RV-GOMEA are combined with a new fitness-based linkage learning approach that is inspired by differential grouping that reduces its computational overhead by an order of magnitude for problems with fewer interactions. The resulting new version of RV-GOMEA achieves scalability similar to when a predefined linkage model is used, outperforming also, for the first time, the EDA AMaLGaM upon which it is partially based in a black-box setting where partial evaluations cannot be leveraged.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3039698","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9265419","Fitness;genetic algorithm;linkage learning;real-valued optimization;scalability","Couplings;Statistics;Sociology;Optimization;Adaptation models;Search problems;Scalability","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","differential grouping;mutual information-based metric;fitness-based linkage learning approach;black-box setting;core strength;partial evaluations;gray-box optimization problems;RV-GOMEA;real-valued gene-pool optimal mixing evolutionary algorithm","","1","","41","IEEE","20 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, evolutionary neural architecture search (EvoNAS) has received increasing attention due to the attractive global optimization capability of evolutionary algorithms. However, EvoNAS suffers from extremely high computational costs because a large number of performance evaluations are usually required in evolutionary optimization, and training deep neural networks is itself computationally very expensive. To address this issue, this article proposes a computationally efficient framework for the evolutionary search of convolutional networks based on a directed acyclic graph, in which parents are randomly sampled and trained on each mini-batch of training data. In addition, a node inheritance strategy is adopted so that the fitness of all offspring individuals can be evaluated without training them. Finally, we encode a channel attention mechanism in the search space to enhance the feature processing capability of the evolved neural networks. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on the widely used datasets, in comparison with 30 state-of-the-art peer algorithms. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is not only computationally much more efficient but also highly competitive in learning performance.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3040272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9268174","Attention mechanism;convolutional neural networks (CNNs);evolutionary optimization;neural architecture search (NAS);node inheritance","Computer architecture;Neural networks;Training;Optimization;Graphics processing units;Statistics;Sociology","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);directed graphs;evolutionary computation;optimisation;search problems","feature processing capability;directed acyclic graph;search space;channel attention mechanism;node inheritance strategy;computationally efficient framework;evolutionary optimization;performance evaluations;high computational costs;evolutionary algorithms;attractive global optimization capability;EvoNAS;evolutionary neural architecture search;automated network architecture design;neural architecture search strategies;deep neural networks;sampled training;attention convolutional networks;efficient evolutionary search","","26","","81","IEEE","24 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article demonstrates how evolutionary AI can be used to facilitate the next step, i.e., determining most effective intervention strategies automatically. Through evolutionary surrogate-assisted prescription, it is possible to generate a large number of candidate strategies and evaluate them with predictive models. In principle, strategies can be customized for different countries and locales, and balance the need to contain the pandemic and the need to minimize their economic impact. Early experiments suggest that workplace and school restrictions are the most important and need to be designed carefully. They also demonstrate that results of lifting restrictions can be unreliable, and suggest creative ways in which restrictions can be implemented softly, e.g., by alternating them over time. As more data becomes available, the approach can be increasingly useful in dealing with COVID-19 as well as possible future pandemics.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3063217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9366776","Decision support systems;evolutionary computation;neural networks;neuroevolution;predictive models;prescriptive models;surrogate modeling;uncertainty estimation","Predictive models;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Pandemics;Diseases;Optimization;COVID-19","artificial intelligence;decision support systems;diseases;evolutionary computation;health care;medical information systems","evolutionary AI;school closures;candidate strategies;evolutionary surrogate-assisted prescription;effective intervention strategies;business closures;social distancing restrictions;COVID-19 pandemic spreads;nonpharmaceutical interventions;evolutionary optimization;future pandemics;school restrictions;workplace;locales;predictive models;time 19.0 as","","22","","67","IEEE","2 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
