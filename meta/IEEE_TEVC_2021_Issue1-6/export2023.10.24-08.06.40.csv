Such problems pose great challenges to most existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which require a large number of function evaluations for optimization. Surrogate-assisted EAs (SAEAs) have been employed to solve expensive MOPs. Specifically, a certain number of expensive function evaluations are used to build computationally cheap surrogate models for assisting the optimization process without conducting expensive function evaluations. The infill sampling criteria in most existing SAEAs take all requirements on convergence, diversity, and model uncertainty into account, which is, however, not the most efficient in exploiting the limited computational budget. Thus, this article proposes a Kriging-assisted two-archive EA for expensive many-objective optimization. The proposed algorithm uses one influential point-insensitive model to approximate each objective function. Moreover, an adaptive infill criterion that identifies the most important requirement on convergence, diversity, or uncertainty is proposed to determine an appropriate sampling strategy for reevaluations using the expensive objective functions. The experimental results on a set of expensive multi/many-objective test problems have demonstrated its superiority over five state-of-the-art SAEAs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3073648","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976165,61903178,61590922,U20A20306); U.K. Royal Society Exchange Program(grant numbers:IEC\NSFC\170279); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9406113","Adaptive sampling strategy;evolutionary algorithms (EAs);expensive multiobjective optimization;Kriging;surrogate assisted","Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Convergence;Adaptation models;Predictive models;Data models;Computational modeling","constraint handling;evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation;search problems;statistical analysis","Kriging-assisted two-archive evolutionary algorithm;expensive many-objective optimization;real-world multiobjective optimization problems;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;surrogate-assisted EAs;expensive MOPs;expensive function evaluations;computationally cheap surrogate models;optimization process;existing SAEAs;Kriging-assisted two-archive EA;objective function approximation;expensive objective functions","","65","","58","IEEE","16 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Objective space normalization has been widely used in multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). Without objective space normalization, most of the MOEAs may fail to obtain uniformly distributed and well-converged solutions on MOPs with differently scaled objectives. Objective space normalization requires information on the Pareto front (PF) range, which can be acquired from the ideal and nadir points. Since the ideal and nadir points of a real-world MOP are usually not known a priori, many recently proposed MOEAs tend to estimate and update the two points adaptively during the evolutionary process. Different methods to estimate ideal and nadir points have been proposed in the literature. Due to inaccurate estimation of the two points (i.e., inaccurate estimation of the PF range), objective space normalization may deteriorate the performance of an MOEA. Different methods have also been proposed to alleviate the negative effects of inaccurate estimation.

Due to its powerful feature construction ability, genetic programming (GP) is used to construct feature-based transformations that map the feature space of the source domain to that of the target domain such that their differences are reduced. Particularly, this work proposes a new multitree GP-based feature construction approach to TL in symbolic regression with missing values. It transfers knowledge related to the importance of the features and instances in the source domain to the target domain to improve the learning performance. Moreover, new genetic operators are developed to encourage minimizing the distribution discrepancy between the transformed domain and the target domain. A new probabilistic crossover is developed to make the well-constructed trees in the individuals more likely to be mated than the other trees. A new mutation operator is designed to give more probability for the poorly constructed trees to be mutated.

Traditional multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) show poor performance in solving MMOPs due to a lack of diversity maintenance in the decision space. Thus, recently, many multimodal MOEAs (MMEAs) have been proposed. However, for most existing MMEAs, the convergence performance in the objective space does not meet expectations. In addition, many of them cannot always obtain all equivalent Pareto solution sets. To address these issues, this study proposes an MMEA based on a weighted indicator, termed MMEA-WI. The algorithm integrates the diversity information of solutions in the decision space into an objective space performance indicator to maintain the diversity in the decision space and introduces a convergence archive to ensure a more effective approximation of the Pareto-optimal front (PF). These strategies can readily be applied to other indicator-based MOEAs. The experimental results show that MMEA-WI outperforms some state-of-the-art MMEAs on the chosen benchmark problems in terms of the inverted generational distance (IGD) and IGD in the decision space (IGDX) metrics.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3078441","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72071205,7207010433); Hunan Youth Elite Program(grant numbers:2018RS3081); Scientific Key Research Project of National University of Defense Technology(grant numbers:ZK18-02-09,ZZKY-ZX-11-04); Key Project(grant numbers:193-A11- 101-03-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9426953","Diversity-preserving mechanisms;evolutionary computation;indicator-based algorithms;multimodal multiobjective optimization","Optimization;Convergence;Statistics;Sociology;Pareto optimization;Task analysis;Sensitivity","convergence;evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation","convergence performance;equivalent Pareto solution sets;termed MMEA-WI;objective space performance indicator;convergence archive;Pareto-optimal front;indicator-based MOEA;chosen benchmark problems;decision space metrics;weighted indicator-based evolutionary algorithm;multimodal multiobjective optimization;multimodal multiobjective problems;MMOP;multiple Pareto-optimal solution;Pareto front;traditional multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;diversity maintenance;multimodal MOEA;state-of-the-art MMEA;PF;IGDX","","45","","51","IEEE","10 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The predominant approach has been to construct single large global models that cover the domain. However, training and evaluating models of increasing size comes at the price of additional time and computational cost. Conditional computation, sparsity, and model pruning techniques can reduce these costs while maintaining performance. Learning classifier systems (LCSs) are a framework for adaptively subdividing input spaces into an ensemble of simpler local approximations that together cover the domain. LCS perform conditional computation through the use of a population of individual gating/guarding components, each associated with a local approximation. This article explores the use of an LCS to adaptively decompose the input domain into a collection of small autoencoders, where local solutions of different complexity may emerge. In addition to the benefits in convergence time and computational cost, it is shown possible to reduce the code size as well as the resulting decoder computational cost when compared with the global model equivalent.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3079320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9427963","Autoencoder;evolutionary algorithm (EA);learning classifier system (LCS);neural network;self-adaptation;stochastic gradient descent;XCSF","Neural networks;Statistics;Sociology;Neurons;Computational modeling;Decoding;Computational efficiency","approximation theory;data compression;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;pattern classification","conditional computation;model pruning;learning classifier systems;LCS;autoencoders;autoencoding;evolutionary algorithm;data-specific compression","","8","","62","IEEE","11 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Greedy-based methods can provide solutions of reliable accuracy, but the computational cost of the required Monte Carlo simulations renders them infeasible for large networks. Meanwhile, although network structure-based centrality methods can be efficient, they typically achieve poor recognition accuracy. Here, we establish an effective influence assessment model based both on the total valuation and variance in valuation of neighbor nodes, motivated by the possibility of unreliable communication channels. We then develop a discrete moth-flame optimization method to search for influence-maximizing node sets, using a local crossover and mutation evolution scheme atop the canonical moth position updates. To accelerate convergence, a search area selection scheme derived from a degree-based heuristic is used.

For some COPs, the evaluation of the objective(s) and/or constraint(s) may involve significant computational/temporal/financial cost. Such problems are referred to as expensive COPs (ECOPs). Surrogate modeling has been widely used in conjunction with optimization methods for such problems, wherein the search is partially driven by an approximate function instead of true expensive evaluations. However, for any true evaluation, nearly all existing methods compute all objective and constraint values together as one batch. Such full evaluation approaches may be inefficient for cases where the objective/constraint(s) can be evaluated independently of each other. In this article, we propose and study a constraint handling strategy for ECOPs using partial evaluations. The constraints are evaluated in a sequence determined based on their likelihood of being violated; and the evaluation is aborted if a constraint violation is encountered. Modified ranking strategies are introduced to effectively rank the solutions using the limited information thus obtained, while saving on significant function evaluations. The proposed algorithm is compared with a number of its variants to establish the utility of its key components systematically. Numerical experiments and benchmarking are conducted on a range of mathematical and engineering design problems to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach compared to state-of-the-art evolutionary optimization approaches.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3078486","Australian Research Council through Discovery(grant numbers:DP190102591,DP190101271); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9426940","Constraint handling;selective evaluation;sequencing;surrogate-assisted optimization","Optimization;Constraint handling;Computational modeling;Search problems;Tools;Safety;Automobiles","approximation theory;constraint handling;evolutionary computation;optimisation;search problems","partial evaluation strategies;expensive evolutionary constrained optimization;constrained optimization problems;expensive COPs;ECOPs;surrogate modeling;approximate function;mathematical engineering design problems","","18","","65","IEEE","10 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, while many neural architecture search algorithms utilize performance estimation techniques to reduce computation time, empirical evaluations of these performance estimation techniques remain limited. This work focuses on utilizing evolutionary neural architecture search to examine the search space of networks, which follow a fundamental DenseNet structure, but have no fixed skip connections. In particular, a genetic algorithm is designed, which searches the space consisting of all networks between a standard feedforward network and the corresponding DenseNet. To design the algorithm, lower fidelity performance estimation of this class of networks is examined and presented. The final algorithm finds networks that are more accurate than DenseNets on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, and have fewer trainable parameters. The structures found by the algorithm are examined to shed light on the importance of different types of skip-connection structures in convolutional neural networks, including the discovery of a simple skip-connection removal, which improves DenseNet performance on CIFAR10.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3083315","Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1913,VUW1914); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge (SfTI) Fund(grant numbers:E3603/2903); University Research Fund at Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:223805/3986); MBIE Data Science SSIF Fund(grant numbers:RTVU1914); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61876169); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439793","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);evolutionary neural architecture search;genetic algorithms;neural architecture search (NAS);skip connections","Estimation;Computer architecture;Convolutional neural networks;Training;Visualization;Task analysis;Probability distribution","convolutional neural nets;genetic algorithms;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture;search problems","evolutionary neural architecture search;high-dimensional skip-connection structures;DenseNet style networks;neural architecture search algorithms;high performance convolutional neural networks;performance estimation techniques;search space;standard feedforward network;lower fidelity performance estimation;simple skip-connection removal;image classification;genetic algorithm;CIFAR10;CIFAR100","","35","","41","IEEE","24 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such methods, a key step is to produce new solutions for each generation. However, traditional EAs cannot guarantee the feasibility of the new solutions, causing ineffectiveness or inefficiency of the methods. Owing to the fact that directly generating a feasible solution is difficult, a practical way is to generate a potential solution and transform it to a feasible one if necessary; more ideally, transform it to the local-optimal solution. Essentially, this transforming process is to map an element of the solution set to an element of the feasible solution set, which can be analyzed and optimized from a new perspective, i.e., the set theory (ST). In this article, we provide new explanations for the transforming process of solutions based on ST and summarize the properties that the transforming process should satisfy. Furthermore, based on the proposed concepts and theories, we put forward the ideas for improving the transforming process. Consequently, some new operators for KPs are proposed.

In the new algorithm framework, a divide-and-conquer strategy is employed to split the training data and the population into small subsets or groups to reduce computational time. A new KT method is proposed to improve GP learning performance. A new fitness function based on log loss and a new ensemble formulation strategy are developed to build an effective ensemble for image classification. The performance of the proposed approach has been examined on 12 image classification datasets of varying difficulty. The results show that the new approach achieves better classification performance in significantly less computation time than the baseline GP-based algorithm.
