Genetic programming (GP), as a hyperheuristic approach, has been successfully applied to evolve scheduling heuristics for JSS. However, its training process is time consuming, and it faces the retraining problem once the characteristics of job shop scenarios vary. It is known that multitask learning is a promising paradigm for solving multiple tasks simultaneously by sharing knowledge among the tasks. To improve the training efficiency and effectiveness, this article proposes a novel surrogate-assisted evolutionary multitask algorithm via GP to share useful knowledge between different scheduling tasks. Specifically, we employ the phenotypic characterization for measuring the behaviors of scheduling rules and building a surrogate for each task accordingly. The built surrogates are used not only to improve the efficiency of solving each single task but also for knowledge transfer in multitask learning with a large number of promising individuals. The results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the quality of scheduling heuristics for all scenarios.

The performance of a differential evolution algorithm depends highly on its mutation and crossover strategy and associated control parameters. However, the determination process for the most suitable parameter setting is troublesome and time consuming. Adaptive control parameter methods that can adapt to problem landscape and optimization environment are more preferable than fixed parameter settings. This article proposes a novel adaptive parameter control approach based on learning from the optimization experiences over a set of problems. In the approach, the parameter control is modeled as a finite-horizon Markov decision process. A reinforcement learning algorithm, named policy gradient, is applied to learn an agent (i.e., parameter controller) that can provide the control parameters of a proposed differential evolution adaptively during the search procedure. The differential evolution algorithm based on the learned agent is compared against nine well-known evolutionary algorithms on the CEC'13 and CEC'17 test suites. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs competitively against these compared algorithms on the test suites.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3060811","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11991023,62076197); Major Project of National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1811461); Key Project of National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11690011); Project of National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61721002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9359652","Adaptive differential evolution;deep learning;global optimization;policy gradient (PG);reinforcement learning (RL)","Statistics;Sociology;Optimization;Process control;Deep learning;Reinforcement learning;Convergence","adaptive control;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;optimisation","evolutionary algorithms;adaptive differential evolution algorithm;optimization experiences;prestigious population-based stochastic optimization algorithm;black-box problems;mutation;crossover strategy;associated control parameters;suitable parameter setting;adaptive control parameter methods;problem landscape;optimization environment;fixed parameter settings;novel adaptive parameter control approach;finite-horizon Markov decision process;reinforcement learning algorithm;named policy gradient;parameter controller;learned agent","","37","","65","IEEE","19 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each indicator-based MOEA (IB-MOEA) has specific search preferences related to its baseline QI, producing Pareto front approximations with different properties. In consequence, an IB-MOEA based on a single QI has a limited scope of multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) in which it is expected to have a good performance. This issue is emphasized when the associated Pareto front geometries are highly irregular. In order to overcome these issues, we propose here an island-based multiindicator algorithm (IMIA) that takes advantage of the search biases of multiple IB-MOEAs through a cooperative scheme. Our experimental results show that the cooperation of multiple IB-MOEAs allows IMIA to perform more robustly (considering several QIs) than the panmictic versions of its baseline IB-MOEAs as well as several state-of-the-art MOEAs. Additionally, IMIA shows a Pareto-front-shape invariance property, which makes it a remarkable optimizer when tackling MOPs with complex Pareto front geometries.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3061545","CONACyT(grant numbers:1920); 2018 SEP-Cinvestav Grant (application no. 4); Basque Government through the Program by the Spanish Ministry of Science(grant numbers:BERC 2018–2021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9360871","Island model;multiobjective optimization;quality indicators (QIs);selection mechanism","Optimization;Shape;Geometry;Convergence;Computer science;Steady-state;Evolutionary computation","evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation;search problems","indicator-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;quality indicators;QIs;selection mechanisms;indicator-based MOEA;IB-MOEA;search preferences;Pareto front approximations;multiobjective optimization problems;Pareto front geometries;island-based multiindicator algorithm;IMIA;search biases;multiple IB-MOEAs;baseline IB-MOEAs;Pareto-front-shape invariance property","","15","","52","IEEE","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Adaptive computational resource allocation (CRA) strategy is able to identify the efficiency of different subspaces and invest search effort on them accordingly in an online manner. A crucial issue for CRA is to measure the efficiency of subspaces. Unfortunately, existing approaches for efficiency measurement are either fitness improvement oriented or contribution oriented, which struggle to capture the potentials of subspaces accurately. To mitigate such drawback, we present an ensemble method for CRA, based on the recent fitness contribution rates (FCRs) and fitness improvement rates (FIRs) of subspaces simultaneously. In order to dynamically track the potential of each subregion, we adopt two memory matrices to record FIR and FCR for multiple subspaces over recent generations, respectively. Afterward, an aptitude vector indicating the potentials of subspaces is defined by exploiting FCR and FIR with memory and decaying scheme. On the basis of above strategies, an ensemble CRA (ECRA) scheme is designed, which is then embedded into an adaptive objective space partition-based DEA, termed ECRA-DEA, for solving the multi/many-objective optimization. Extensive experimental studies for ECRA-DEA on various types of challenging problems have been carried out and the results confirm that ECRA is effective. Besides, the competence of ECRA-DEA is empirically validated in comparison with state-of-the-art designs. The proposed ECRA paves a new way to leverage the capability of DEAs on handling complex problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3060899","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101704); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51825502,51905198); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M652630,2020T130225); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9359650","Decomposition;dynamic resource allocating;ensemble;multiobjective optimization;objective space partition","Optimization;Finite impulse response filters;Resource management;Computational modeling;Convergence;Pareto optimization;Heuristic algorithms","evolutionary computation;optimisation;resource allocation","dynamic resource allocation strategies;decomposition-based multiobjective optimization;evolutionary algorithms;adaptive computational resource allocation strategy;search effort;fitness improvement;ensemble method;multiple subspaces;decaying scheme;ensemble CRA scheme;adaptive objective space partition-based DEA;ECRA-DEA","","12","","34","IEEE","19 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this challenge, we propose a dual-population-based evolutionary algorithm, named c-DPEA, for CMOPs. c-DPEA is a cooperative coevolutionary algorithm which maintains two collaborative and complementary populations, termed Population1 and Population2. In c-DPEA, a novel self-adaptive penalty function, termed saPF, is designed to preserve competitive infeasible solutions in Population1. On the other hand, infeasible solutions in Population2 are handled using a feasibility-oriented approach. To maintain an appropriate balance between convergence and diversity in c-DPEA, a new adaptive fitness function, named bCAD, is developed. Extensive experiments on three popular test suites comprehensively validate the design components of c-DPEA.

However, some of the MMOEAs prefer convergent individuals over diversified individuals to construct the mating pool, and the individuals with slightly better decision space distribution may be replaced by significantly better objective space distribution. Therefore, the diversity in the decision space may become deteriorated, in spite of the decision and objective diversities have been taken into account simultaneously in most MMOEAs. Because the Pareto optimal subsets may have various shapes and locations in the decision space, it is very difficult to drive the individuals converged to every Pareto subregion with a uniform density. Some of the Pareto subregions may be overly crowded, while others are rather sparsely distributed. Consequently, many existing MMOEAs obtain Pareto subregions with imbalanced density. In this article, we present a two-stage double niched evolution strategy, namely DN-MMOES, to search for the equivalent global Pareto optimal solutions which can address the above challenges effectively and efficiently. The proposed DN-MMOES solves the multimodal multiobjective optimization problem (MMOP) in two stages. The first stage adopts the niching strategy in the decision space, while the second stage adapts double niching strategy in both spaces. Moreover, an effective decision density self-adaptive strategy is designed for improving the imbalanced decision space density. The proposed algorithm is compared against eight state-of-the-art MMOEAs. The inverted generational distance union (IGDunion) performance indicator is proposed to fairly compare two competing MMOEAs as a whole. The experimental results show that DN-MMOES provides a better performance to search for the complete Pareto Subsets and Pareto Front on IDMP and CEC 2019 MMOPs test suite.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3064508","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702383,U1803262,61602350); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9372341","Evolution strategy;multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MMOEA);multimodal multiobjective optimization problem (MMOP)","Pareto optimization;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Spatial diversity;Search problems;Object recognition;Statistics","decision theory;genetic algorithms;Pareto optimisation;search problems;set theory","multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;Pareto optimal subsets;DN-MMOES;equivalent global Pareto optimal solutions;multimodal multiobjective optimization problem;double niching strategy;imbalanced decision space density;Pareto front;decision density self-adaptive strategy;complete Pareto subsets","","21","","41","IEEE","8 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among them, the social learning particle swarm optimization (SLPSO) has shown good performance. However, as SLPSO uses different guidance information for different particles to maintain the diversity, it often results in slow convergence speed. Therefore, this article proposes a new region encoding scheme (RES) to extend the solution representation from a single point to a region, which can help EC algorithms evolve faster. The RES is generic for EC algorithms and is applied to SLPSO. Based on RES, a novel adaptive region search (ARS) is designed to on the one hand keep the diversity of SLPSO and on the other hand accelerate the convergence speed, forming the SLPSO with ARS (SLPSO-ARS). In SLPSO-ARS, each particle is encoded as a region so that some of the best (e.g., the top P) particles can carry out region search to search for better solutions near their current positions. The ARS strategy offers the particle a greater chance to discover the nearby optimal solutions and helps to accelerate the convergence speed of the whole population. Moreover, the region radius is adaptively controlled based on the search information. Comprehensive experiments on all the problems in both IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2010 (CEC 2010) and 2013 (CEC 2013) competitions are conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of SLPSO-ARS and to investigate its important parameters and components. The experimental results show that SLPSO-ARS can achieve generally better performance than the compared algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3065659","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2102102); Outstanding Youth Science Foundation(grant numbers:61822602); National Natural Science Foundations of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61772207,61873097); Key-Area Research and Development of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B010166002); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation Research Team(grant numbers:2018B030312003); Guangdong-Hong Kong Joint Innovation Platform(grant numbers:2018B050502006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377474","Adaptive region search (ARS);evolutionary computation (EC);large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs);region encoding scheme (RES);social learning particle swarm optimization (SLPSO)","Convergence;Statistics;Sociology;Optimization;Search problems;Acceleration;Encoding","convergence;evolutionary computation;particle swarm optimisation;search problems","RES;adaptive region search;SLPSO-ARS;solution encoding;evolutionary computation algorithms;social learning particle swarm optimization;convergence speed;region encoding scheme","","47","","60","CCBY","12 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are employed to tackle these problems, they not only face a contradiction between the precision of surrogate models and the cost of individual evaluations but also have the difficulty that surrogate models and problem modalities are hard to match. To address this issue, this article studies a dual-surrogate-assisted cooperative particle swarm optimization algorithm to seek multiple optimal solutions. A dual-population cooperative particle swarm optimizer is first developed to simultaneously explore/exploit multiple modalities. Following that, a modal-guided dual-layer cooperative surrogate model, which contains one upper global surrogate model and a group of lower local surrogate models, is constructed with the purpose of reducing the individual evaluation cost. Moreover, a hybrid strategy based on clustering and peak-valley is proposed to detect new modalities. Compared with five existing SAEAs and seven multimodal evolutionary algorithms, the proposed algorithm can simultaneously obtain multiple highly competitive optimal solutions at a low computational cost according to the experimental results of testing both 11 benchmark instances and the building energy conservation problem.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3064835","Key Research and Development Program in Xuzhou(grant numbers:KC20184); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876185,61876184); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9373610","Coevolution;expensive optimization;multimodal;particle swarm optimization (PSO);surrogate-assisted","Optimization;Clustering algorithms;Particle swarm optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Prediction algorithms;Sun","energy conservation;evolutionary computation;optimisation;particle swarm optimisation;search problems","lower local surrogate models;individual evaluation cost;seven multimodal evolutionary algorithms;highly competitive optimal solutions;building energy conservation problem;expensive multimodal optimization problems;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms;problem modalities;dual-surrogate-assisted cooperative particle swarm optimization algorithm;multiple optimal solutions;particle swarm optimizer;multiple modalities;modal-guided dual-layer;upper global surrogate model","","59","","56","IEEE","9 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
