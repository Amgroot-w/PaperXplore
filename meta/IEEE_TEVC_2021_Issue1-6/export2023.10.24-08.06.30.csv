While some evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been developed to find the equivalent Pareto-optimal solutions in recent years, they are ineffective to handle large-scale MMOPs having a large number of variables. This article thus proposes an EA for solving large-scale MMOPs with sparse Pareto-optimal solutions, i.e., most variables in the optimal solutions are 0. The proposed algorithm explores different regions of the decision space via multiple subpopulations and guides the search behavior of the subpopulations via adaptively updated guiding vectors. The guiding vector for each subpopulation not only provides efficient convergence in the huge search space but also differentiates its search direction from others to handle the multimodality. While most existing EAs solve MMOPs with 2-7 decision variables, the proposed algorithm is shown to be effective for benchmark MMOPs with up to 500 decision variables. Moreover, the proposed algorithm also produces a better result than state-of-the-art methods for the neural architecture search.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3044711","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0100100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672033,61822301,61876123,61906001,U1804262); Hong Kong Scholars Program(grant numbers:XJ2019035); Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:1808085J06,1908085QF271); State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries(grant numbers:PAL-N201805); CCF-Tencent Open Research Fund(grant numbers:RAGR20200121); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:CityU11202418,CityU11209219); Royal Society International Exchanges Program(grant numbers:IEC\NSFC\170279); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9295397","Evolutionary algorithm (EA);large-scale optimization;multimodal multiobjective optimization;neural architecture search;sparse Pareto-optimal solutions","Computer architecture;Pareto optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Microprocessors;Optimization;Extraterrestrial measurements","evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation;search problems","multipopulation evolutionary algorithm;real-world applications;multiple equivalent Pareto optimal solutions;objective space;decision space;multiple subpopulations;search behavior;adaptively updated guiding vectors;huge search space;decision variables;benchmark MMOP;existing EA;sparse Pareto optimal solution;large scale MMOP;large scale multimodal multiobjective optimization problem","","44","","68","IEEE","15 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Great achievements have been made in robustness optimization based on single measures, however, such networks may still be vulnerable to multiple attack scenarios. Therefore, recently, multiobjective robustness optimization of networks has received increasing attention. Nevertheless, several challenges remain to be addressed, including the different computational complexities in evaluating the objectives, insufficient diversity in the obtained networks, and high computational costs of the search process. In this article, we address the aforementioned challenges by developing a computationally efficient multiobjective optimization algorithm. Based on the unique features of complex networks, a new parallel fitness evaluation method guided by a network property parameter is designed and embedded in a reference vector-guided multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. In addition, a surrogate ensemble with heterogeneous inputs is constructed based on graph embedding information to efficiently estimate multiple robustness of networks. The proposed algorithm is validated on synthetic and real-world network data and our results show that the designed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art method with a marked improvement on the computational efficiency.

The new novelty metric is based on the transformed semantics of models in GP, where the semantics are the set of outputs of a model on the training data and principal component analysis is used for a transformation of the semantics. Based on the new novelty metric, a new diversity preserving framework, which incorporates a new fitness function and a new selection operator, is proposed to help GP achieve a good balance between the exploration and the exploitation, thus enhancing its learning and generalization performance. Compared with two stat-of-the-art diversity preserving methods, the new method can generalize better and reduce the overfitting trend more effectively in most cases.

When the number of objectives or decision variables is scaled up in CMOPs, the performance of EAs may degenerate dramatically and may fail to obtain any feasible solutions. To address this issue, we propose a paired offspring generation-based multiobjective EA for constrained large-scale optimization. The general idea is to emphasize the role of offspring generation in reproducing some promising feasible or useful infeasible offspring solutions. We first adopt a small set of reference vectors for constructing several subpopulations with a fixed number of neighborhood solutions. Then, a pairing strategy is adopted to determine some pairwise parent solutions for offspring generation. Consequently, the pairwise parent solutions, which could be infeasible, may guide the generation of well-converged solutions to cross the infeasible region(s) effectively. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on CMOPs with up to 1000 decision variables and ten objectives. Moreover, each component in the proposed algorithm is examined in terms of its effect on the overall algorithmic performance.

First, it formulates a multilevel prediction approach in which a higher level prediction improves the accuracy of the lower level prediction to reduce the prediction error, enabling it to capture more complex patterns in the changes. However, a higher level prediction is more sensitive to input errors and the randomness in the pattern of the change. To overcome this challenge, this study employs an adaptive mechanism which can determine the near-optimal prediction level at each time step. At the same time, AMLP calculates the strength of the diversity introduced after a change based on the estimated prediction error. A successful static multimodal optimizer is augmented with AMLP, for which AMLP determines the location and the mutation strength of the initialized subpopulations. An existing dynamic benchmark generator is improved so that it can generate dynamic test problems with more complex patterns in their changes. In particular, this dynamic benchmark generator allows for controlling the randomness of the pattern in the change to simulate dynamic problems with different degrees of predictability. A few controlled experiments are first performed to provide insight into different components of AMLP. Then, AMLP is compared with some of the most successful prediction methods when they are incorporated into the developed dynamic multimodal optimization method. Eleven dynamic cases with different change severity, change frequency, predictability, problem dimensionality, and the number of global minima are considered.

A common method to deal with this issue is to seek for a less expensive surrogate model to replace the original expensive objective function. However, this method also brings in model approximation error. To efficiently solve the EOP, a novel scale-adaptive fitness evaluation (SAFE) method is proposed in this article to directly evaluate the true fitness value of the solution on the original objective function. To reduce the computational cost, the SAFE method uses a set of evaluation methods (EM) with different accuracy scales to cooperatively complete the fitness evaluation process. The basic idea is to adopt the low-accuracy scale EM to fast locate promising regions and utilize the high-accuracy scale EM to refine the solution accuracy. To this aim, two EM switch strategies are proposed in the SAFE method to adaptively control the multiple EMs according to different evolutionary stages and search requirements. Moreover, a neighbor best-based evaluation (NBE) strategy is also put forward to evaluate the solution according to its nearest high-quality evaluated solution, which can further reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments are carried out on the case study of crowdshipping scheduling problem in the smart city to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SAFE method, and to investigate the effects of the two EM switch strategies and the NBE strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed SAFE method achieves better solution quality than some baseline and state-of-the-art algorithms, indicating an efficient method for solving EOP with a better balance between solution accuracy and computational cost.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3051608","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2102102); Outstanding Youth Science Foundation(grant numbers:61822602); National Natural Science Foundations of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61772207,61873097); Key-Area Research and Development of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B010166002); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation Research Team(grant numbers:2018B030312003); Guangdong–Hong Kong Joint Innovation Platform(grant numbers:2018B050502006); Hong Kong GRFRGC General Research Fund(grant numbers:9042816,CityU 11209819); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9324797","Crowdshipping scheduling;expensive optimization problem (EOP);fitness evaluation (FE) method","Linear programming;Optimization;Computational efficiency;Iron;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Task analysis","adaptive control;approximation theory;genetic algorithms;scheduling;search problems;smart cities","expensive optimization problems;EOP;original objective function;SAFE method;evaluation methods;fitness evaluation process;EM switch strategies;scale-adaptive fitness evaluation method;approximation error.;neighbor best-based evaluation;NBE;adaptive control;evolutionary stages;search requirements;smart city;crowdshipping scheduling problem","","74","","60","CCBY","14 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Self-adaptive mechanisms not only free users from low-level and complex development tasks to enhance optimization efficiency but also allow them to focus on addressing high-level real-world operational requirements. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to improve self-adaptive mechanisms. However, learning to optimize hard combinatorial optimization problems remains a challenging task. This article proposes a new genetic programming approach to evolve efficient variable selectors to enhance the search mechanism in constraint programming. Starting with a set of training instances for a specific combinatorial optimization problem, the proposed approach evaluates variable selectors and evolves them to be more efficient over a number of generations. The novelties of our proposed approach are threefold: 1) a new representation of variable selectors; 2) a new mechanism for fitness evaluations; and 3) a preselection technique. We examine performance of the proposed approach on different job-shop scheduling problems, and the results show that variable selectors can be evolved efficiently. In particular, there are substantial reductions in the computational effort required for the search component of the constraint solver as well as increased chances of finding the optimal solutions. Further analyses also confirm the efficacy of our approach in respect to scalability, generalization, and interpretability of the evolved variable selectors.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3050465","David Myers Research Fellowship from La Trobe University; Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1509); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9319512","Genetic programming (GP);heuristics;job-shop scheduling (JSS);makespan;tardiness","Optimization;Job shop scheduling;Search problems;Schedules;Programming;Constraint handling;Training","artificial intelligence;combinatorial mathematics;constraint handling;genetic algorithms;job shop scheduling;learning (artificial intelligence);operations research","genetic programming approach;evolving variable selectors;constraint programming;operational researchers;decision modelers;optimization technologies;self-adaptive mechanism;problem formulations;complex development tasks;optimization efficiency;high-level real-world operational requirements;machine learning;artificial intelligence techniques;hard combinatorial optimization problems;efficient variable selectors;search mechanism;specific combinatorial optimization problem;job-shop scheduling problems;constraint solver;evolved variable selectors;optimal solutions","","2","","60","IEEE","11 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, a general evolutionary game model composed of green-sensitive governments, enterprises, and consumers is built by considering the policy factors, and the evolutionary stable strategies of this model are solved. The solution results reveal that the green sensitivities significantly affect the evolutionary dynamics and stable strategies of the model. Green supply chains can evolve from low to advanced stages as the green sensitivities increase. At low development stages, governments must take the lead in enhancing their green sensitivity, resort to two key composite policy factor solutions, and encourage enterprises and consumers to increase their green sensitivities and drive them to adopt green strategies. As the green sensitivities of both enterprises and consumers have progressively increased to a certain high level, governments can adopt a nonsupervision strategy, reaching an advanced evolutionary stable strategy with the enterprises and consumers having complete autonomy. Therefore, green sensitivity has been proven to be a substitute for policy factors for green supply chain development. Moreover, the advanced strategy cannot be reached by any policy factor composition without green sensitivity. The findings above clarify the significance of green sensitivity, indicating that specific government policies based on the specific green sensitivities of the three parties can improve green supply chain management.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3052173","National Natural Science Foundation, China(grant numbers:71771195,71401153,71701182,71902171); Second Batch Teaching Reform Research Project of Zhejiang Higher Education 13th Five-year Plan(grant numbers:jg20190293); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9327484","Evolutionary game;green sensitivity;green supply chains;policy factors;three parties","Green products;Government;Supply chains;Sensitivity;Games;Production;Carbon tax","environmental economics;evolutionary computation;game theory;government policies;supply chain management","green-sensitive parties;green sensitivity;green-sensitive governments;green strategies;green supply chain development;green supply chain management;evolutionary game analysis;low-carbon strategies;evolutionary game theory;governmental policies;carbon tax;subsidies;policy factors;evolutionary dynamics;nonsupervision strategy","","37","","58","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Performance predictors are a type of regression models which can assist to accomplish the search, while without exerting much computational resource. Despite various performance predictors have been designed, they employ the same training protocol to build the regression models: 1) sampling a set of DNNs with performance as the training dataset; 2) training the model with the mean square error criterion; and 3) predicting the performance of DNNs newly generated during the ENAS.

Furthermore, we propose a new training protocol to address these issues, consisting of designing a pairwise ranking indicator to construct the training target, proposing to use the logistic regression to fit the training samples, and developing a differential method to build the training instances.

In this problem, machine assignment and operation sequencing decisions need to be made simultaneously under the dynamic environments. Genetic programming (GP), as a hyperheuristic approach, has been successfully used to evolve scheduling heuristics for dynamic flexible JSS. However, in traditional GP, recombination between parents may disrupt the beneficial building blocks by choosing the crossover points randomly. This article proposes a recombinative mechanism to provide guidance for GP to realize effective and adaptive recombination for parents to produce offspring. Specifically, we define a novel measure for the importance of each subtree of an individual, and the importance information is utilized to decide the crossover points. The proposed recombinative guidance mechanism attempts to improve the quality of offspring by preserving the promising building blocks of one parent and incorporating good building blocks from the other. The proposed algorithm is examined on six scenarios with different configurations. The results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on most tested scenarios, in terms of both final test performance and convergence speed. In addition, the rules obtained by the proposed algorithm have good interpretability.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3056143","Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1509,VUW1614); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge (SfTI)(grant numbers:E3603/2903); MBIE SSIF Fund(grant numbers:VUW RTVU1914); China Scholarship Council (CSC)/Victoria University Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9344816","Correlation coefficient;dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (JSS);genetic programming (GP);hyperheuristics;recombinative guidance","Dynamic scheduling;Job shop scheduling;Sequential analysis;Processor scheduling;Routing;Genetic programming;Heuristic algorithms","combinatorial mathematics;genetic algorithms;job shop scheduling;optimisation","dynamic flexible JSS;traditional GP;beneficial building blocks;crossover points;recombinative mechanism;effective recombination;adaptive recombination;recombinative guidance mechanism attempts;promising building blocks;incorporating good building blocks;correlation coefficient-based recombinative guidance;genetic programming hyperheuristics;dynamic flexible job shop scheduling;challenging combinatorial optimization problem;complex environment;operation sequencing decisions;dynamic environments;hyperheuristic approach;scheduling heuristics","","37","","70","IEEE","2 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has been demonstrated that the knowledge embedded in the past search experience can greatly speed up the evolutionary process if properly harnessed. Autoencoding evolutionary search (AEES) is a recently proposed search paradigm, which employs a single-layer denoising autoencoder to build the mapping between two problems by configuring the solutions of each problem as the input and output for the autoencoder, respectively. The learned mapping makes it possible to perform knowledge transfer across heterogeneous problem domains with diverse properties. It has shown a promising performance of learning and transferring the knowledge from past search experiences to facilitate the evolutionary search on a variety of optimization problems. However, despite the success enjoyed by AEES, the linear autoencoding model cannot capture the nonlinear relationship between the solution sets used in the mapping construction. Taking this cue, in this article, we devise a kernelized autoencoder to construct the mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), where the nonlinearity among problem solutions can be captured easily. Importantly, the proposed kernelized autoencoding method also holds a closed-form solution which will not bring much computational burden in the evolutionary search. Furthermore, a kernelized autoencoding evolutionary-search (KAES) paradigm is proposed that adaptively selects the linear and kernelized autoencoding along the search process in pursuit of effective knowledge transfer across problem domains. To validate the efficacy of the proposed KAES, comprehensive empirical studies on both benchmark multiobjective optimization problems as well as real-world vehicle crashworthiness design problem are presented.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3056514","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61876025); Venture and Innovation Support Program for Chongqing Overseas Returnees(grant numbers:cx2018044,cx2019020); A*STAR Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS)—Towards Contextual and Intelligent Response Research Program, through the RIE2020 IAF-PP(grant numbers:A19C1a0018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9344841","Evolutionary optimization;kernelization;knowledge transfer;nonlinear","Optimization;Search problems;Noise reduction;Sociology;Knowledge transfer;Kernel;Genetic algorithms","evolutionary computation;Hilbert spaces;optimisation;search problems","learnable evolutionary search;heterogeneous problem;evolutionary algorithm;learning capability;autoencoding evolutionary search;AEES;single-layer denoising autoencoder;linear autoencoding model;kernelized autoencoder;kernel Hilbert space;knowledge transfer;multiobjective optimization;real-world vehicle crashworthiness design problem","","23","","54","IEEE","2 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The detector set is the core knowledge set, and the AIS application effects are mainly determined by the generation, evolution, and detection of the detectors. Presently, the problem space (shape-space) of AIS mainly applied real-valued representation. But the real-valued detectors have some problems that have not been solved well, such as slow convergence speed of generation, holes in the nonself region, detector overlapping redundancy, dimension curse, etc., which lead to the unsatisfactory detection effects. Moreover, artificial immune anomaly detection is a dynamic adaptive model, needs to be evolved adaptively with the detection environments. Without better adaptive modeling, these problems mentioned before will get worse. In view of this, this article proposes a multisource immune detector adaptive model in neighborhood shape-space and applies it to anomaly detection: based on random, chaotic map and DNA genetic algorithm (DNA-GA), multisource neighborhood negative selection algorithm (MSNNSA), multisource neighborhood immune detector generation algorithm (MS-NIDGA), and neighborhood immune anomaly detection algorithm (NIADA) are proposed, so that the generation and detection of immune detectors can be improved efficiently; introducing immune adaptive and feedback mechanism, multisource neighborhood immune detector adaptive model (MS-NIDAM) is built, so that the detectors can be adaptively evolved in a more targeted search domain, and keep better distribution to the nonself region in real time, so as to solve various problems existing in the real-valued shape-space under dynamic environment mentioned before and improve the overall detection performances. The experimental results show that MS-NIDAM can improve the detector generation/evolution efficiency, keep the up-to-date understanding of the changing environment, so as to obtain better overall detection performances and stability than other comparative methods.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3058687","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61172168); Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province(grant numbers:F2018019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9352964","Adaptive evolution;anomaly detection;artificial immune system (AIS);negative selection algorithm;neighborhood shape-space","Detectors;Immune system;Artificial intelligence;Adaptation models;Vaccines;DNA;Anomaly detection","artificial immune systems;DNA;genetic algorithms;set theory","neighborhood shape-space;DNA genetic algorithm;neighborhood immune anomaly detection algorithm;feedback mechanism;multisource neighborhood immune detector adaptive model;nonself region;real-valued shape-space;detection performances;artificial immune system;artificial intelligence technology;AIS application effects;real-valued detectors;unsatisfactory detection effects;artificial immune anomaly detection;dynamic adaptive model;multisource neighborhood negative selection algorithm;MSNNSA;MS-NIDGA;multisource neighborhood immune detector generation algorithm","","2","","42","IEEE","11 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A typical way to achieve good generalization is to learn a model from vast data. In the context of heuristic search, such a paradigm could be implemented as configuring the parameters of a parallel algorithm portfolio (PAP) based on a set of “training” problem instances, which is often referred to as PAP construction. However, compared to the traditional machine learning, PAP construction often suffers from the lack of training instances, and the obtained PAPs may fail to generalize well. This article proposes a novel competitive co-evolution scheme, named co-evolution of parameterized search (CEPS), as a remedy to this challenge. By co-evolving a configuration population and an instance population, CEPS is capable of obtaining generalizable PAPs with few training instances. The advantage of CEPS in improving generalization is analytically shown in this article. Two concrete algorithms, namely, CEPS-TSP and CEPS-VRPSPDTW, are presented for the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup–delivery and time windows (VRPSPDTW), respectively. The experimental results show that CEPS has led to better generalization, and even managed to find new best-known solutions for some instances.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3059661","Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); Shenzhen Peacock Plan(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:19511120600); National Leading Youth Talent Support Program of China; MOE University Scientific-Technological Innovation Plan Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9354852","Algorithm configuration;automatic parameter tuning;co-evolution;parallel algorithm portfolios (PAPs);vehicle routing problems","Training;Portfolios;Tuning;Statistics;Sociology;Parallel algorithms;Machine learning algorithms","investment;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel algorithms;search problems;travelling salesman problems;vehicle routing","vehicle routing problem;shots parallel algorithm portfolio construction;system design;development phase;intelligent systems;vast data;heuristic search;training problem instances;PAP construction;parameterized search;configuration population;instance population;generalizable PAPs;concrete algorithms;CEPS-TSP;CEPS-VRPSPDTW;traveling salesman problem;named coevolution;novel competitive coevolution scheme;machine learning;coevolution of parameterized search","","16","","45","CCBYNCND","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
