It is used not only for performance evaluation of EMO algorithms (EMOAs) but also in indicator-based EMOAs to guide the search. Since its initial proposal in the late 1990s, a wide variety of studies have been done on various topics, including hypervolume calculation, optimal μ-distribution, subset selection, hypervolume-based EMOAs, and extensions of the hypervolume indicator. However, currently there is no work to systematically survey the hypervolume indicator for these topics whereas it has been frequently used in the EMO field. This article aims to fill this gap and provide a comprehensive survey on the hypervolume indicator.

Inverted generational distance (IGD) has been widely accepted as a performance indicator for evaluating the comprehensive quality for a PF approximation. However, IGD usually becomes infeasible when facing a real-world optimization problem as it needs to know the true PF a priori. In addition, the time complexity of IGD grows quadratically with the size of the solution/reference set. To address the aforementioned issues, a grid-based IGD (Grid-IGD) is proposed to estimate both convergence and diversity of PF approximations for multi/many-objective optimization. In Grid-IGD, a set of reference points is generated by estimating PFs of the problem in question, based on the representative nondominated solutions of all the approximations in a grid environment. To reduce the time complexity, Grid-IGD only considers the closest solution within the grid neighborhood in the approximation for every reference point. Grid-IGD also possesses other desirable properties, such as Pareto compliance, immunity to dominated/duplicate solutions, and no need of normalization. In the experimental studies, Grid-IGD is verified on both the artificial and real PF approximations obtained by five many-objective optimizers. Effects of the grid specification on the behavior of Grid-IGD are also discussed in detail theoretically and experimentally.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.2991040","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61300159,61732006,61876075,61572127,61872077,61832004); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China(grant numbers:BK20181288); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2015M571751); Aeronautical Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:20175552042); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9080110","Grid system;inverted generational distance (IGD);many-objective optimization;performance indicator","Time complexity;Computer science;Convergence;Pareto optimization;Computational efficiency;Indexes","approximation theory;computational complexity;evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation","Pareto front approximations;evolutionary many-objective optimization;grid-based IGD;grid-based inverted generational distance;evolutionary multiobjective optimization;performance indicator;real-world optimization problem;time complexity;representative nondominated solutions;grid environment;grid neighborhood;Pareto compliance;real PF approximation;artificial PF approximations;duplicate solutions","","33","","50","IEEE","28 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The most appealing feature of hyper-heuristics is that they aim to provide more generalized solutions to optimization problems by searching in a high-level space of heuristics instead of direct problem domains. Despite the promising findings in hyper-heuristics, the design of more general search methodologies still presents a key research. Evolutionary multitasking is a relatively new evolutionary paradigm which attempts to solve multiple optimization problems simultaneously. It exploits the underlying similarities among different optimization tasks by transferring information among them, thus accelerating the optimization of all tasks. Inherently, hyper-heuristics and evolutionary multitasking are similar in the following three ways: 1) they both operate on third-party search spaces; 2) high-level search methodologies are universal; and 3) they both conduct cross-domain optimization. To integrate their advantages effectively, i.e., the knowledge-transfer and cross-domain optimization of evolutionary multitasking and the search in the heuristic spaces of hyper-heuristics, in this article, a unified framework of evolutionary multitasking graph-based hyper-heuristic (EMHH) is proposed. To assess the generality and effectiveness of the EMHH, population-based graph-based hyper-heuristics integrated with evolutionary multitasking to solve exam timetabling and graph-coloring problems, separately and simultaneously, are studied. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and increased the generality of the proposed unified framework compared with single-tasking hyper-heuristics.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.2991717","General Program of NSFC(grant numbers:61773300); Doctoral Students Short-Term Study Abroad Scholarship Fund of Xidian University; School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, United Kingdom; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9084121","Evolutionary multitasking;exam timetabling;graph coloring;hyper-heuristics","Optimization;Task analysis;Multitasking;Schedules;Search problems;Scheduling;Linear programming","evolutionary computation;graph colouring;optimisation;search problems","graph based evolutionary multitasking hyperheuristic;high level search methodologies;evolutionary multitasking graph based hyperheuristic;population based graph based hyperheuristics;crossdomain optimization;third party search spaces;graph coloring problem","","32","","46","IEEE","1 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So far, most studies have used the Das and Dennis's structured approach for generating well-spaced reference points. Due to the highly structured nature of the procedure, this method cannot produce an arbitrary number of points, which is desired in an EMaO application. Although a layer-wise implementation has been suggested, EMO researchers always felt the need for a more generic approach. Motivated by earlier studies, we introduce a metric for defining well-spaced points on a unit simplex and propose a number of viable methods for generating such a set. We compare the proposed methods on a variety of performance metrics such as hypervolume (HV), deviation in triangularized simplices, distance of the closest point pair, and variance of the geometric means to nearest neighbors in up to 15-D spaces. We show that an iterative improvement based on Riesz s-energy is able to effectively find an arbitrary number of well-spaced points even in higher-dimensional spaces.

Previously, setting up the system to perform well has been a “blackart” as no systematic approach to XCS parameter tuning existed. We derive a theoretical approach that mathematically guarantees that XCS identifies the accurate rules, which also returns a theoretically valid XCS parameter setting.

Accordingly, a promising-region-based evolutionary many-objective algorithm with the ratio-based indicator is proposed. In our proposed algorithm, a promising region is identified in the objective space using the ratio-based indicator with infinite norm. Since the individuals outside the promising region are of poor quality, we can discard these solutions from the current population. To ensure the diversity of population, a strategy based on the parallel distance is introduced to select individuals in the promising region. In this strategy, all individuals in the promising region are projected vertically onto the normal plane so that crowded distances between them can be calculated. Afterward, two solutions with a smaller distance are selected from the candidate solutions each time, and the solution with the smaller indicator fitness value is removed from the current population. Empirical studies on various benchmark problems with 3-20 objectives show that the proposed algorithm performs competitively on all test problems.

However, extracting effective features from images is challenging due to high variations across images in scale, rotation, illumination, and background. Existing methods often have a fixed model complexity and require domain expertise. Genetic programming (GP) with a flexible representation can find the best solution without the use of domain knowledge. This article proposes a new GP-based approach to automatically learning informative features for different image classification tasks. In the new approach, a number of image-related operators, including filters, pooling operators, and feature extraction methods, are employed as functions. A flexible program structure is developed to integrate different functions and terminals into a single tree/solution. The new approach can evolve solutions of variable depths to extract various numbers and types of features from the images. The new approach is examined on 12 different image classification tasks of varying difficulty and compared with a large number of effective algorithms. The results show that the new approach achieves better classification performance than most benchmark methods. The analysis of the evolved programs/solutions and the visualization of the learned features provide deep insights on the proposed approach.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3002229","Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1509,VUW1615); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge(grant numbers:E3603/2903); University Research Fund at Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:223805/3986); Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Data Science SSIF Fund(grant numbers:RTVU1914); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876169); China Scholarship Council/Victoria University Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9117044","Evolutionary computation (EC);feature learning;genetic programming (GP);image classification;representation","Feature extraction;Task analysis;Histograms;Principal component analysis;Benchmark testing;Kernel;Artificial neural networks","feature extraction;genetic algorithms;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection","high-level features;fixed model complexity;genetic programming;flexible representation;GP-based approach;informative features;image-related operators;pooling operators;extraction methods;flexible program structure;image classification tasks;classification performance;feature learning;feature extraction;low-level pixel values","","33","","57","IEEE","15 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To remedy this issue, this article proposes a coevolutionary framework for constrained multiobjective optimization, which solves a complex CMOP assisted by a simple helper problem. The proposed framework evolves one population to solve the original CMOP and evolves another population to solve a helper problem derived from the original one. While the two populations are evolved by the same optimizer separately, the assistance in solving the original CMOP is achieved by sharing useful information between the two populations. In the experiments, the proposed framework is compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms tailored for CMOPs. High competitiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by applying it to 47 benchmark CMOPs and the vehicle routing problem with time windows.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3004012","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0100100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672033,61822301,61876123,61906001,61590922,U1804262); Hong Kong Scholars Program(grant numbers:XJ2019035); Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:1808085J06,1908085QF271); State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries(grant numbers:PAL-N201805); Royal Society International Exchanges Program(grant numbers:IEC\NSFC\170279); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:63192616); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9122020","Coevolution;constrained multiobjective optimization;evolutionary algorithm;vehicle routing problem","Sociology;Statistics;Optimization;Constraint handling;Evolutionary computation;Convergence;Vehicle routing","evolutionary computation;optimisation;vehicle routing","coevolutionary framework;constrained multiobjective optimization problems;complex CMOP;vehicle routing problem;helper problem;evolutionary algorithms;optimizer","","183","","59","IEEE","22 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Transfer learning-based approaches have been proven to be promising; however, a slow solving speed is one of the main obstacles preventing such methods from solving real-world problems. One of the reasons for the slow running speed is that low-quality individuals occupy a large amount of computing resources, and these individuals may lead to negative transfer. Combining high-quality individuals, such as knee points, with transfer learning is a feasible solution to this problem. However, the problem with this idea is that the number of high-quality individuals is often very small, so it is difficult to acquire substantial improvements using conventional transfer learning methods. In this article, we propose a knee point-based transfer learning method, called KT-DMOEA, for solving DMOPs. In the proposed method, a trend prediction model (TPM) is developed for producing the estimated knee points. Then, an imbalance transfer learning method is proposed to generate a high-quality initial population by using these estimated knee points. The advantage of this approach is that the seamless integration of a small number of high-quality individuals and the imbalance transfer learning technique can greatly improve the computational efficiency while maintaining the quality of the solution. The experimental results and performance comparisons with some chosen state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that the proposed design is capable of significantly improving the performance of dynamic optimization.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3004027","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61673328); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9122031","Domain adaptation;evolutionary dynamic multiobjective optimization;knee point;prediction;transfer learning","Optimization;Sociology;Statistics;Heuristic algorithms;Predictive models;Learning systems;Convergence","learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation","multiple conflicting optimization objectives;slow solving speed;negative transfer;DMOPs;dynamic optimization;knee point-based imbalanced transfer learning;dynamic multiobjective optimization problems;computational efficiency;trend prediction model;TPM;KT-DMOEA","","73","","46","IEEE","22 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce the computational cost on the decomposition, we propose an efficient recursive differential grouping (ERDG) method in this article. By exploiting the historical information on examining the interrelationship between the variables of an optimization problem, ERDG is able to avoid examining some interrelationship and spend much less computation than other recursive differential grouping methods. Our experimental results and analysis suggest that ERDG is a competitive method for decomposing large-scale continuous problems and improves the performance of CC for solving the large-scale optimization problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3009390","Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2019CFB584); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61305086,61673355); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan(grant numbers:CUGL170412); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9141328","Cooperative co-evolution (CC);decomposition;large-scale global optimization","Optimization;Computational efficiency;Geology;Computer science;Electronic mail;Computational complexity;Automation","evolutionary computation;optimisation","computational resources;practical evolutionary framework;large-scale optimization problems;large-scale continuous problems;competitive method;optimization problem;ERDG;recursive differential grouping method;computational cost;variable decomposition","","36","","33","IEEE","15 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Artificial test problems are critical to the progress in this research area. Nevertheless, many of them lack important characteristics, such as scalability and variable dependencies, which may be essential in benchmarking modern evolutionary algorithms. This article first proposes a new framework for constrained test problem construction. This framework splits a decision vector into position and distance variables and forces their optimal values to lie on a nonlinear hypersurface such that the interdependencies can be introduced among the position ones and among the distance ones individually. In this framework, two kinds of constraints are designed to introduce convergence-hardness and diversity-hardness, respectively. The first kind introduces infeasible barriers in approaching the optima, and at the same time, makes the position and distance variables interrelate with each other. The second kind restricts the feasible optimal regions such that different shapes of Pareto fronts can be obtained. Based on this framework, we construct 16 scalable and constrained test problems covering a variety of difficulties. Then, in the second part of this article, we evaluate the performance of some state of the art on the proposed test problems, showing that they are quite challenging and there is room for further enhancement of the existing algorithms. Finally, we discuss in detail the source of difficulties presented in these new problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3011829","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61773410,61673403,61906069); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:2019A1515111154); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou(grant numbers:202002030355); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149679","Constraint optimization;evolutionary algorithms;local search;multi/many-objective optimization","Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Shape;Maintenance engineering;Performance evaluation;Benchmark testing;Convergence","evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation;search problems","constrained multiobjective optimization;evolutionary computation community;artificial test problems;variable dependencies;constrained test problem construction;distance variables;position ones;distance ones;feasible optimal regions;scalable test problems;constrained test problems;Pareto fronts","","24","","46","IEEE","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Often, a population of fixed size is used in such algorithms to record some best solutions sampled during the search. However, given the particular features of the problem instance under consideration, a population of variable size would be more suitable to ensure the best search performance possible. In this work, we propose a variable population memetic search (VPMS), where a strategic population sizing mechanism is used to dynamically adjust the population size during the search process. Our VPMS approach starts its search from a small population of only two solutions to focus on exploitation and then adapts the population size according to the search status to continuously influence the balancing between exploitation and exploration. We illustrate an application of the VPMS approach to solve the challenging critical node problem (CNP). We show that the VPMS algorithm integrating a variable population, an effective local optimization procedure, and a backbone-based crossover operator performs very well compared to state-of-the-art CNP algorithms. The algorithm is able to discover new upper bounds for 12 instances out of the 42 popular benchmark instances while matching 23 previous best-known upper bounds.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.3011959","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61903144); Shanghai Sailing Program(grant numbers:19YF1412400); Key Project of Science and Technology Innovation 2030 Supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101302); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(grant numbers:222201817006); Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission(grant numbers:JCYJ20180508162601910); Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society(grant numbers:2019-INT003); Open Project of the Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (Exploration Project 2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149656","Critical node problem (CNP);local search;memetic search;population sizing","Sociology;Statistics;Memetics;Optimization;Genetic algorithms;Search problems;Heuristic algorithms","combinatorial mathematics;genetic algorithms;search problems","search process;VPMS approach;search status;critical node problem;VPMS algorithm;CNP algorithms;population size;strategic population sizing mechanism;variable population memetic search;search performance possible;variable size;problem instance;fixed size;combinatorial problems;population-based memetic algorithms","","18","","45","IEEE","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
