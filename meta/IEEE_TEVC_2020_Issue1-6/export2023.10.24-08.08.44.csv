Unfortunately, almost all experimental studies have focused on problems having regular Pareto fronts (PFs). Recently, it has been shown that the performance of such algorithms is deteriorated when facing irregular PFs, such as degenerate, discontinuous, inverted, strongly convex, and/or strongly concave fronts. The main issue is that the predefined reference points may not all intersect with the PF. Therefore, many researchers have proposed to update the reference points with the aim of adapting them to the discovered Pareto shape. Unfortunately, the adaptive update does not really solve the issue for two main reasons. On the one hand, there is a considerable difficulty to set the time and the frequency of updates. On the other hand, it is not easy to define how to update the search directions for an unknown PF shape. This article proposes to approximate irregular PFs using a set of predefined normal-boundary intersection (NBI) directions. The main motivation behind this article is that when using a set of well-distributed NBI directions, all these directions intersect with the PF regardless of its shape, except for the case of discontinuous and/or degenerate fronts. To handle the latter cases, a simple interaction mechanism between the decision maker (DM) and the algorithm is used. In fact, the DM is asked if the number of NBI directions needs to be increased in some stages of the evolutionary process. If so, the resolution of the NBI directions that intersect the PF is increased to properly cover discontinuous and/or degenerate PFs. Our experimental results on benchmark problems with regular and irregular PFs, having up to fifteen objectives, show the merits of our algorithm when compared to eight of the most representative state-of-the-art algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2958921","2018 SEP-Cinvestav Fund (Application no. 4); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8931629","Decomposition;evolutionary many-objective optimization;irregular Pareto fronts (PFs);normal-boundary intersection (NBI) directions","Shape;Mirrors;Evolutionary computation;Pareto optimization;Sociology","evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation","complex Pareto fronts;decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms;many-objective optimization;discovered Pareto shape;unknown PF shape;well-distributed NBI directions;concave fronts;normal-boundary intersection directions","","20","","53","IEEE","12 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to multiobjective optimization, MTO solves multiple optimization tasks simultaneously. MTO aims to improve the overall performance of multiple tasks through knowledge transfer among tasks. Recently, MTO has attracted the attention of many researchers, and several algorithms have been proposed in the literature. However, one of the crucial issues, finding useful knowledge, has been rarely studied. Keeping this in mind, this article proposes an MTO algorithm based on incremental learning (EMTIL). Specifically, the transferred solutions (the form of knowledge) will be selected by incremental classifiers, which are capable of finding valuable solutions for knowledge transfer. The training data are generated by the knowledge transfer at each generation. Furthermore, the search space of the tasks will be explored by the proposed mapping (among tasks) approach, which helps these tasks to escape from their local Pareto Fronts. Empirical studies have been conducted on 15 MTO problems to assess the effectiveness of EMTIL. The experimental results demonstrate that EMTIL works more effectively for MTO compared to the existing algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2962747","Programme of Science and Technology of Guangzhou(grant numbers:201804010352); Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1509,VUW1615); University Research Fund at Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:216378/3764); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8944273","Evolutionary algorithms;incremental learning;knowledge transfer;multitask optimization","Task analysis;Optimization;Knowledge transfer;Evolutionary computation;Heuristic algorithms;Problem-solving;Cloud computing","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);Pareto optimisation;pattern classification","multiobjective multitasking optimization;incremental learning;multiobjective optimization;multiple optimization tasks;knowledge transfer;MTO algorithm;incremental classifiers;local Pareto fronts;EMTIL","","48","","44","IEEE","27 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One promising approach for understanding quality indicators is the use of the optimal distribution of objective vectors that optimizes each quality indicator. However, it is difficult to obtain the optimal distribution for each quality indicator, especially, when its theoretical property is unknown. Thus, optimal distributions for most quality indicators have not been well investigated. To address these issues, first, we propose a problem formulation of finding the optimal distribution for each quality indicator on an arbitrary Pareto front. Then, we approximate the optimal distributions for nine quality indicators using the proposed problem formulation. We analyze the nine quality indicators using their approximated optimal distributions on eight types of Pareto fronts of three-objective problems. Our analysis demonstrates that uniformly distributed objective vectors over the entire Pareto front are not optimal in many cases. Each quality indicator has its own optimal distribution for each Pareto front. We also examine the consistency among the nine quality indicators.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.2966014","Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); Shenzhen Peacock Plan(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); Science and Technology Innovation Committee Foundation of Shenzhen(grant numbers:ZDSYS201703031748284); Program for University Key Laboratory of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017KSYS008); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876075); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8957371","Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO);optimal distributions of objective vectors;quality indicators","Convergence;Linear programming;Pareto optimization;Decision making;Benchmark testing;Indexes","evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation","Pareto front;evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms;approximated optimal distributions;quality indicator","","24","","60","IEEE","13 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, we formulate a time-varying RE estimation (TREE) problem into a large-scale multiobjective optimization problem, where the multiple objectives and inequality constraints are formulated by statistical and physical rules extracted from the power delivery systems. Furthermore, a set of TREE problems from different substations is systematically formulated into a benchmark test suite for characterizing their different properties. The formulation of these TREE problems not only transfers an expensive RE estimation task to a relatively cheaper optimization problem but also promotes the research in large-scale multiobjective optimization by providing a real-world benchmark test suite with complex variable interactions and correlations to different objectives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to formulate a real-world problem into a benchmark test suite for large-scale multiobjective optimization, and it is also the first work proposing to solve TREE problems via evolutionary multiobjective optimization.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.2967501","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61903178,61906081); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); Shenzhen Peacock Plan(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); Program for University Key Laboratory of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017KSYS008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8962275","Benchmark test suite;inequality constraint;large-scale multiobjective optimization;time-varying ratio error estimation (TREE);voltage transformer (VT)","Voltage measurement;Optimization;Calibration;Substations;Estimation;Error analysis;Benchmark testing","evolutionary computation;optimisation;potential transformers;time-varying systems","ratio error estimation;voltage transformers;VTs;power delivery systems;time-varying property;time-varying RE estimation problem;large-scale multiobjective optimization problem;TREE problems;expensive RE estimation task;real-world benchmark test suite;evolutionary multiobjective optimization","","47","","64","IEEE","17 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a space division strategy based on the feature importance is presented, which can classify relevant features into the same subspace with a low computational cost. Following that, an adaptive adjustment mechanism of subswarm size is developed to maintain an appropriate size for each subswarm, with the purpose of saving computational cost on evaluating particles. Moreover, a particle deletion strategy based on fitness-guided binary clustering, and a particle generation strategy based on feature importance and crossover both are designed to ensure the quality of particles in the subswarms. We apply VS-CCPSO to 12 typical datasets and compare it with six state-of-the-art methods.

However, a definite characteristic among them is that only a single optimization task can be catched up at a time. Inspired by the multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA), a novel interval MFEA (IMFEA) is proposed to solve IMOOPs simultaneously using a single population of evolving individuals. In the proposed method, the potential interdependency across related problems can be explored in the unified genotype space, and multitasks of multiobjective interval optimization problems are solved at once by promoting knowledge transfer for the greater synergistic search to improve the convergence speed and the quality of the optimal solution set. Specifically, an interval crowding distance based on shape evaluation is calculated to evaluate the interval solutions more comprehensively. In addition, an interval dominance relationship based on the evolutionary state of the population is designed to obtain the interval confidence level, which considers the difference of average convergence levels and the relative size of the potential possibility between individuals. Correspondingly, the strict transitivity proof of the presented dominance relationship is given. The efficacy of the associated evolutionary algorithm is validated on a series of benchmark test functions, as well as a real-world case of robot path planning with many terrains that provides insight into the performance of the method in the face of IMOOPs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.2975381","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51805059); Basic Science and Advanced Technology Research in Chongqing(grant numbers:cstc2019jcyj-msxmX0080); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9004543","Interval dominance relationship;interval multiobjective optimization (IMOOP);multifactorial evolution","Task analysis;Optimization;Sociology;Statistics;Evolutionary computation;Uncertainty;Multitasking","genetic algorithms;mobile robots;Pareto optimisation;path planning;radiofrequency identification","interval confidence level;robot path;IMOOP;multifactorial evolutionary algorithm;multitasking;real-world applications;interval uncertainty;path planning;mobile robot;radio frequency identification readers;solar desalination;interval multiobjective optimization problem;unified genotype space;multiobjective interval optimization problems;optimal solution;interval crowding distance;interval dominance relationship;evolutionary state;interval MFEA","","34","","48","IEEE","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, they still often suffer from two difficulties. First, many existing methods for building a single ad hoc surrogate are suitable for some special problems but may not work well on some other problems. Second, the optimization accuracy of DDEAs deteriorates if available data are not enough for building accurate surrogates, which is common in expensive optimization problems. To this end, this article proposes a novel DDEA with two efficient components. First, a boosting strategy (BS) is proposed for self-aware model managements, which can iteratively build and combine surrogates to obtain suitable surrogate models for different problems. Second, a localized data generation (LDG) method is proposed to generate synthetic data to alleviate data shortage and increase data quantity, which is achieved by approximating fitness through data positions. By integrating the BS and the LDG, the BDDEA-LDG algorithm is able to improve model accuracy and data quantity at the same time automatically according to the problems at hand. Besides, a tradeoff is empirically considered to strike a better balance between the effectiveness of surrogates and the time cost for building them. The experimental results show that the proposed BDDEA-LDG algorithm can generally outperform both traditional methods without surrogates and other state-of-the-art DDEA son widely used benchmarks and an arterial traffic signal timing real-world optimization problem. Furthermore, the proposed BDDEA-LDG algorithm can use only about 2% computational budgets of traditional methods for producing competitive results.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.2979740","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2102102); Outstanding Youth Science Foundation(grant numbers:61822602); National Natural Science Foundations of China(grant numbers:61772207,61873097); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation Research Team(grant numbers:2018B030312003); Ministry of Science and ICT through the National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2019H1D3A2A01101977); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9039758","Boosting strategy (BS);data-driven evolutionary algorithm (DDEA);expensive optimization problems (EOPs);localized data generation (LDG);surrogate","Optimization;Iron;Data models;Buildings;Boosting;Computational modeling;Adaptation models","data analysis;evolutionary computation;optimisation","single ad hoc surrogate;expensive optimization problems;self-aware model managements;localized data generation method;BDDEA-LDG algorithm;boosting data-driven evolutionary algorithm;DDEAs;arterial traffic signal timing real-world optimization problem","","100","","79","CCBY","17 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these two issues, this article proposes a strategy to detect whether or not the search is stuck in these two stagnation states and then escape from them. Our proposed detect-and-escape strategy uses the feasible ratio and the change rate of overall constraint violation to detect stagnation, and adjusts the weight of the constraint violation for guiding the search to escape from stagnation states.

For a given solution space, there exists an infinite number of grammars defining that space, and there are clues that changing the grammar may impact the effectiveness of the optimization. In this article, we investigate theoretically and experimentally the possibility of specializing a grammar in a problem, that is, of systematically improving the quality of the grammar for the given problem. To this end, we define the quality of a grammar for a problem in terms of the average fitness of the candidate solutions generated using that grammar. Theoretically, we demonstrate the following findings: 1) that a simple mutation operator employed in a (1 + 1)-EA setting can be used to specialize a grammar in a problem without changing the solution space defined by the grammar and 2) that three grammars of equal quality for a grammar-based version of the ONEMAX problem greatly vary in how they can be specialized with that (1 + 1)-EA, as the expected time required to obtain the same improvement in quality can vary exponentially among grammars. Then, experimentally, we validate the theoretical findings and extend them to other problems, grammars, and a more general version of the mutation operator.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.2983664","National Funds through Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) by the project GADgET(grant numbers:DSAIPA/DS/0022/2018); AICE(grant numbers:DSAIPA/DS/0113/2019,UID/MULTI/00308/2019); European Regional Development Fund through the COMPETE 2020 Programme, FCT—Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology and Regional Operational Program of the Center Region (CENTRO2020) within project MAnAGER (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-028040); Slovenian Research Agency(grant numbers:P5-0410); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9047973","Grammar design;grammatical evolution;run time analysis","Grammar;Computational modeling;Optimization;Production;Sociology;Statistics;Evolutionary computation","context-free grammars;optimisation","solution space;context-free grammars;optimization algorithm;OneMax problem","","3","","52","IEEE","26 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, an efficient self-adaptive precision controllable mutation operator is designed for individuals to explore and exploit the decision space. Second, the simulated isotropic magnetic particles niching can guide the individuals to keep uniform distance and extent to approximate the entire Pareto front automatically. Third, the nondominated solutions (NDS) guided immigration can facilitate the population convergence with two different strategies for the NDSs and the dominated solutions, respectively. As a result, our algorithm can track the new approximate Pareto set and approximate Pareto front as quickly as possible when the environment changes. In addition, DMOES can obtain a well-converged and well-diversified Pareto front with much less population size and far lower computational cost. The larger the number of individuals, the sharper the contour of the resulted approximate Pareto front will be. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated by the FDA, dMOP, UDF, and ZJZ test suites. The experimental results have been demonstrated to provide a competitive and oftentimes better performance when compared against some chosen state-of-the-art dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.2985323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9055401","Dynamic multiobjective optimization problem (DMOP);evolution strategy (ES);multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA);multiobjective optimization problem (MOP)","Sociology;Pareto optimization;Convergence;Heuristic algorithms;Magnetic particles","evolutionary computation;mathematical operators;Pareto optimisation","multiobjective evolution strategy;dynamic multiobjective optimization;named DMOES;multiobjective optimization problems;self-adaptive precision controllable mutation operator;decision space;simulated isotropic magnetic particles niching;uniform distance;nondominated solutions guided immigration;population convergence;approximate Pareto front;dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;evolution strategy-based evolutionary algorithm;NDS","","38","","68","IEEE","2 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
