In this article, we discuss topology optimization as a black-box optimization problem. We review the main BBTO methods, discuss their challenges and present approaches to relax them. Dealing with those challenges effectively can lead to wider applicability of topology optimization, as well as the ability to tackle industrial, highly constrained, nonlinear, many-objective, and multimodal problems. Consequently, future research in this area may open the door for innovating new applications in science and engineering that may go beyond solving classical optimization problems of mechanical structures.

MOEA/Ds work by decomposing the target multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) into multiple single-objective subproblems based on a set of weight vectors. The subproblems are solved cooperatively in an evolutionary algorithm framework. Since weight vectors define the search directions and, to a certain extent, the distribution of the final solution set, the configuration of weight vectors is pivotal to the success of MOEA/Ds. The most straightforward method is to use predefined and uniformly distributed weight vectors. However, it usually leads to the deteriorated performance of MOEA/Ds on solving MOPs with irregular Pareto fronts. To deal with this issue, many weight vector adjustment methods have been proposed by periodically adjusting the weight vectors in a random, predefined, or adaptive way. This article focuses on weight vector adjustment on a simplex and presents a comprehensive survey of these weight vector adjustment methods covering the weight vector adaptation strategies, theoretical analyses, benchmark test problems, and applications. The current limitations, new challenges, and future directions of weight vector adjustment are also discussed.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.2978158","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976143,61871272,61911530218,61603259,61772392); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515010869,2020A151501946); Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20190808173617147); Scientific Research Foundation of Shenzhen University for Newly Introduced Teachers(grant numbers:860/000002110312); Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2018JM6009); Zhejiang Labs International Talent Fund for Young Professionals; National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data System Computing Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9022866","Decomposition-based MOEA;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms based on decomposition (MOEA/D);multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;weight vector adjustment","Sociology;Pareto optimization;Evolutionary computation;Computer science;Shape","evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation","weight vector adjustment methods;decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;target multiobjective optimization problem;evolutionary algorithm framework;MOEA/D;MOP","","91","","119","IEEE","3 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the appropriate parameter setting generally depends on the structure of the optimization problem, which is often unknown to the user. Nondeterministic parameter control mechanisms adjust parameters using information obtained from the evolutionary process. Self-adaptation-where parameter settings are encoded in the chromosomes of individuals and evolve through mutation and crossover-is a popular parameter control mechanism in evolutionary strategies. However, there is little theoretical evidence that self-adaptation is effective, and self-adaptation has largely been ignored by the discrete evolutionary computation community. Here, we show through a theoretical runtime analysis that a nonelitist, discrete EA which self-adapts its mutation rate not only outperforms EAs which use static mutation rates on LEADINGONESk but also improves asymptotically on an EA using a state-of-the-art control mechanism. The structure of this problem depends on a parameter k, which is a priori unknown to the algorithm, and which is needed to appropriately set a fixed mutation rate. The self-adaptive EA achieves the same asymptotic runtime as if this parameter was known to the algorithm beforehand, which is an asymptotic speedup for this problem compared to all other EAs previously studied. An experimental study of how the mutation-rates evolve show that they respond adequately to a diverse range of problem structures. These results suggest that self-adaptation should be adopted more broadly as a parameter control mechanism in discrete, nonelitist EAs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2020.2985450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9056791","Evolutionary algorithm (EA);level-based analysis;runtime analysis;self-adaptation","Optimization;Runtime;Evolutionary computation;Sociology;Statistics;Process control;Tuning","evolutionary computation;search problems","self-adaptive EA;discrete EAs;nonelitist EAs;nonelitist evolutionary algorithms;discrete problems;nondeterministic parameter control mechanisms;evolutionary process;popular parameter control mechanism;evolutionary strategies;discrete EA;static mutation rates;fixed mutation rate;discrete evolutionary computation","","14","","37","IEEE","3 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this approach, given the historical data of satellite scheduling, a prediction model is trained based on the cooperative neuro-evolution of augmenting topologies (C-NEAT) to predict the probabilities that a task will be fulfilled by different satellites. Driven by the probability prediction model, an assignment strategy is adopted for dividing the multi-AEOS scheduling problem into several single-AEOS scheduling subproblems, which can adaptively assign each task to the satellite with the highest predicted probability and greatly decrease the problem size. In a parallel manner, the single-AEOS scheduling subproblems are optimized, respectively, leading to an acceleration in the optimization efficiency of the original problem. Computational experiments indicate that the proposed approach presents better overall performance than other state-of-the-art methods within a very limited scheduling time.

Furthermore, in many subset selection applications, the objective function evaluation is subject to noise. We thus study the large-scale noisy subset selection problem in this paper. The recently proposed DPOSS algorithm based on multiobjective evolutionary optimization is a powerful distributed solver for large-scale subset selection. Its performance, however, has been only validated in the noise-free environment. In this paper, we first prove its approximation guarantee under two common noise models, i.e., multiplicative noise and additive noise, disclosing that the presence of noise degrades the performance of DPOSS largely. Next, we propose a new distributed multiobjective evolutionary algorithm called DPONSS for large-scale noisy subset selection. We prove that the approximation guarantee of DPONSS under noise is significantly better than that of DPOSS. We also conduct experiments on the application of sparse regression, where the objective evaluation is often estimated using a sample data, bringing noise. The results on various real-world data sets, whose size can reach millions, clearly show the excellent performance of DPONSS.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2929555","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFB1003102); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61603367); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765790","Distributed algorithms;experimental studies;large-scale;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs);noise;Pareto optimization;subset selection;theoretical analyses","Linear programming;Noise measurement;Approximation algorithms;Optimization;Greedy algorithms;Additive noise;Distributed algorithms","evolutionary computation;feature selection;Pareto optimisation;regression analysis;set theory","ground set;combinatorial optimization;computer vision;data collection;subset selection applications;objective function evaluation;DPOSS;multiobjective evolutionary optimization;large-scale subset selection;noise-free environment;common noise models;multiplicative noise;additive noise;distributed multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;real-world data sets;distributed Pareto optimization","","21","","43","IEEE","18 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To deal with these two challenges, a distributed individuals differential evolution (DIDE) algorithm is proposed in this article based on a distributed individuals for multiple peaks (DIMP) framework and two novel mechanisms. First, the DIMP framework provides sufficient diversity by letting each individual act as a distributed unit to track a peak. Based on the DIMP framework, each individual uses a virtual population controlled by an adaptive range adjustment strategy to explore the search space sufficiently for locating a peak and then gradually approach it. Second, the two novel mechanisms named lifetime mechanism and elite learning mechanism (ELM) cooperate with the DIMP framework. The lifetime mechanism is inspired by the natural phenomenon that every organism will gradually age and has a limited lifespan. When an individual runs out of its lifetime and also has good fitness, it is regarded as an elite solution and will be added to an archive. Then the individual restarts a new lifetime, so as to bring further diversity to locate more peaks. The ELM is proposed to refine the accuracy of those elite solutions in the archive, being efficient in dealing with the solution accuracy issue on the found peaks. The experimental results on 20 multimodal benchmark test functions show that the proposed DIDE algorithm has generally better or competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art multimodal optimization algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2944180","Outstanding Youth Science Foundation(grant numbers:61822602); National Natural Science Foundations of China(grant numbers:61772207,61873097); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation Research Team(grant numbers:2018B030312003); Guangdong-Hong Kong Joint Innovation Platform(grant numbers:2018B050502006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854301","Differential evolution (DE);distributed individuals DE (DIDE);lifetime mechanism;multimodal optimization","Sociology;Statistics;Optimization;Space exploration;Refining;Aerospace electronics;Learning systems","evolutionary computation;search problems","20 multimodal benchmark test functions;DIDE algorithm;distributed individuals for multiple peaks framework;elite learning mechanism;adaptive range adjustment strategy;DIMP framework;multiple peaks framework;distributed individuals differential evolution algorithm;multimodal optimization algorithms","","88","","45","CCBY","1 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, this article proposes a framework to improve the performance of decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms for multimodal multiobjective optimization. Our framework is based on three operations: 1) assignment; 2) deletion; and 3) addition operations. One or more individuals can be assigned to the same subproblem to handle multiple equivalent solutions. In each iteration, a child is assigned to a subproblem based on its objective vector, i.e., its location in the objective space. The child is compared with its neighbors in the solution space assigned to the same subproblem. The performance of improved versions of six decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms by our framework is evaluated on various test problems regarding the number of objectives, decision variables, and equivalent Pareto optimal solution sets.

This article proposes a low-cost method for estimating the robustness of networks with the help of graph embedding techniques and surrogate models. An evolutionary algorithm is then developed to find large-scale robust networks by combining the surrogate-assisted low-cost robustness estimator with the time-consuming real robustness measure by means of a model management strategy. The experimental results on different kinds of synthetic and real networks demonstrate the highly competitive search ability of the proposed algorithm.

We formulate the problem of designing a bolt supporting network as a three-objective optimization model by simultaneously considering such indicators as quality, economy, and efficiency. Especially, two surrogate models are constructed by support vector regression for roof-to-floor convergence and the two-sided displacement, respectively, so as to rapidly evaluate supporting quality during optimization. To solve the formulated model, a novel interactive preference-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is proposed. The highlight of generic methods which interactively articulate preferences is to systematically manage the regions of interest by three steps, that is, “partitioning-updating-tracking” in accordance with the cognition process of human. The preference regions of a decision-maker (DM) are first articulated and employed to narrow down the feasible objective space before the evolution in terms of nadir point, not the commonly used ideal point. Then, the DM’s preferences are tracked by dynamically updating these preference regions based on satisfactory candidates during the evolution. Finally, individuals in the population are evaluated based on the preference regions. We apply the proposed model and algorithm to design the bolt supporting network of a practical roadway. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate an optimal bolt supporting scheme with a good balance between supporting quality and the other demands, besides speeding up its convergence.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2951217","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973305,61573361,61773384); Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:2017-DZXX-046); State Key Laboratory of Robotics, China(grant numbers:2019-O12); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFB1003802-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8890620","Bolt supporting network;interaction;multiobjective evolutionary optimization;preference;surrogate model","Fasteners;Optimization;Rocks;Stability analysis;Tunneling","civil engineering computing;costing;decision making;design engineering;economics;evolutionary computation;fasteners;floors;optimisation;quality control;regression analysis;roads;roofs;support vector machines;supports","multiobjective evolutionary optimization;supporting quality;supporting cost;support vector regression;bolt supporting networks design;economy;roof-to-floor convergence;cognition process;decision-maker;roadway","","89","","49","IEEE","4 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing algorithms focus on identifying either active modules or topological modules (communities), which represent dynamic and topological units in the network, respectively. However, high-level biological phenomena, e.g., functions are emergent properties from the interplay between network topology and dynamics. Therefore, to fully explain the mechanisms underlying the high-level biological phenomena, it is important to identify the overlaps between communities and active modules, which indicate the topological units with significant changes of dynamics. However, despite the importance, there are no existing methods to do so. In this article, we propose the multitask module identification (MUMI) algorithm to detect the overlaps between active modules and communities simultaneously. The experimental results show that our method provides new insights into biological mechanisms by combining information from active modules and communities. By formulating the problem as a multitasking learning problem which searches for these two types of modules simultaneously, the algorithm can exploit their latent complementarities to obtain better search performance in terms of accuracy and convergence.

However, studies have so far neglected issues concerning comparison strategies necessary to rank optimization algorithms properly. To fill this gap for the first time, we combine voting theory and numerical comparison research areas, which have been disjoint so far, and thus extend the results of the former to the latter for optimization algorithms. In particular, we investigate compatibility issues arising from comparing two and more than two algorithms, termed “C2” and “C2+” in this article, respectively. Through defining and modeling “C2” and “C2+” mathematically, it is uncovered and illustrated that numerical comparison can be incompatible. Further, two possible paradoxes, namely, “cycle ranking” and “survival of the nonfittest,” are discovered and analyzed rigorously. The occurrence probabilities of these two paradoxes are also calculated under the no-free-lunch assumption, which shows the first justifiable use of the impartial culture assumption from voting theory, providing a point of reference to the frequency of the paradoxes occurring. It is also shown that significant influence on these probabilities comes from the number of algorithms and the number of optimization problems studied in the comparison. Further, various limiting probabilities when the number of optimization problems goes to infinity are also derived and characterized. The results would help guide benchmarking and developing optimization and machine learning algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2955110","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2016YFD0400206); National Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China(grant numbers:61525304); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61773119,61873328); Dongguan University of Technology(grant numbers:KCYKYQD2017014,DGUT(Q)-GGB-2016005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8910400","Cycle ranking;evolutionary computation;machine learning;numerical comparison;optimization","Optimization;Benchmark testing;Mathematical model;Numerical models;Machine learning algorithms;Measurement;Convergence","optimisation","optimization algorithms;numerical comparison","","8","","48","CCBY","22 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Subsequently, motivated by the challenges presented by dynamism and constraints, we design a dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization algorithm with a nondominated solution selection operator, a mating selection strategy, a population selection operator, a change detection method, and a change response strategy. The designed nondominated solution selection operator can obtain a nondominated population with diversity when the environment changes. The mating selection strategy and population selection operator can adaptively handle infeasible solutions. If a change is detected, the proposed change response strategy reuses some portion of the old solutions in combination with randomly generated solutions to reinitialize the population, and a steady-state update method is designed to improve the retained previous solutions. The experimental results show that the proposed test problems can be used to clearly distinguish the performance of algorithms, and that the proposed algorithm is very competitive for solving dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization problems in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2958075","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61988101,61525302,61590922,61673331); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFB1701104); Xingliao Plan of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:XLYC1808001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8926382","Change response;dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization;population selection;test problems","Optical fibers;Sociology;Statistics;Heuristic algorithms;Linear programming;Optimization;Convergence","genetic algorithms;Pareto optimisation","change response strategy;evolutionary algorithm;generic test problems;dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization algorithm;mating selection strategy;population selection operator;change detection method;nondominated solution selection operator","","45","","64","IEEE","6 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
