Automating this task, i.e., developing algorithmic procedure to address parameter tuning task, is highly desired and has attracted significant attention from the researchers and practitioners. During last two decades, many automatic parameter tuning approaches have been proposed. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of automatic parameter tuning methods for metaheuristics. A new classification (or taxonomy) of automatic parameter tuning methods is introduced according to the structure of tuning methods. The existing automatic parameter tuning approaches are consequently classified into three categories: 1) simple generate-evaluate methods; 2) iterative generate-evaluate methods; and 3) high-level generate-evaluate methods. Then, these three categories of tuning methods are reviewed in sequence. In addition to the description of each tuning method, its main strengths and weaknesses are discussed, which is helpful for new researchers or practitioners to select appropriate tuning methods to use. Furthermore, some challenges and directions of this field are pointed out for further research.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2921598","Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China(grant numbers:2017YFC0804002); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/J017515/1,EP/P005578/1); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); Shenzhen Peacock Plan(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); Science and Technology Innovation Committee Foundation of Shenzhen(grant numbers:ZDSYS201703031748284,JCYJ20180504165652917); Program for University Key Laboratory of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017KSYS008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8733017","Automatic parameter tuning;metaheuristics;parameter setting;parameter tuning","Tuning;Task analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Computer science;Measurement;Systematics","computational complexity;optimisation","parameter tuning task;automatic parameter tuning methods;parameter settings;metaheuristics","","159","","105","CCBY","10 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a problem of collaborative human-UAV search for escaped criminals, the aim of which is to minimize the expected time of capture rather than detection. We show that our problem is much more complex than the problem of pure UAV search. The difficulty of our problem is further increased by the fact that criminals will attempt to avoid detection and capture. To solve the problem, we propose a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (EA) that uses three evolutionary operators, namely, comprehensive learning, variable mutation, and local search, to efficiently explore the solution space. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms some well-known EAs and other popular UAV search methods on test instances. An application of our method to a real-world operation took 311 min to capture a criminal who had escaped for over three days, validating its practicability and performance advantage.

A mapping function is introduced that allows for converting the strings onto comparator structures-building blocks of sorting networks. The construction of the networks is performed in such a way that a given (initial) sorting network grows progressively by adding further building blocks within each development step.

In this paper, an experimental method is proposed for analyzing the running time of EAs that are widely used for solving continuous optimization problems. Based on Glivenko-Cantelli theorem, the proposed method simulates the distribution of gain, which is introduced by average gain model to characterize progress during the optimization process. Data fitting techniques are subsequently adopted to obtain a desired function for further analyses. To verify the validity of the proposed method, experiments were conducted to estimate the upper bounds on expected first hitting time of various evolutionary strategies, such as (1, $\lambda $ ) evolution strategy, standard evolution strategy, covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, and its improved variants. The results suggest that all estimated upper bounds are correct. Backed up by the proposed method, state-of-the-art EAs for continuous optimization will have identical results about the running time as simplified schemes, which will bridge the gap between theoretical foundation and applications of evolutionary computation.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2921547","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876207); Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar(grant numbers:2014A030306050); Guangdong High-Level Personnel of Special Support Program(grant numbers:2014TQ01X664); International Cooperation Project of Guangzhou(grant numbers:201807010047); Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:201802010007,201804010276); Guangdong Province Key Area Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2018B010109003); Science Technique Department of Guizhou Province(grant numbers:[2019]1164); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8733022","Average gain model;evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for continuous optimization;experimental method;running time analysis","Optimization;Sociology;Evolutionary computation;Switches;Statistical analysis;Analytical models","covariance matrices;evolutionary computation","evolutionary computation;evolutionary algorithms;EAs;continuous optimization problems;Glivenko-Cantelli theorem;average gain model;optimization process;expected first hitting time;evolutionary strategies;covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy","","9","","51","IEEE","10 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The class of DMOPs whose objective functions change over time steps, in ways that exhibit some hidden patterns has gained much attention. Their predictability indicates that the problem exhibits some correlations between solutions obtained in sequential time periods. Most of the current approaches use linear models or similar strategies to describe the correlations between historical solutions obtained, and predict the new solutions in the following time period as an initial population from which the MOEA can begin searching in order to improve its efficiency. However, nonlinear correlations between historical solutions and current solutions are more common in practice, and a linear model may not be suitable for the nonlinear case. In this paper, we present a support vector regression (SVR)-based predictor to generate the initial population for the MOEA in the new environment. The basic idea of this predictor is to map the historical solutions into a high-dimensional feature space via a nonlinear mapping, and to do linear regression in this space. SVR is used to implement this process. We incorporate this predictor into the MOEA based on decomposition (MOEA/D) to construct a novel algorithm for solving the aforementioned class of DMOPs.

However, the use of these neighborhood concepts requires the specification of some problem-related parameters, which is difficult to determine without a prior knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a new neighborhood concept based on a geometrical construction called Voronoi diagram. The new concept offers two advantages at the expense of increasing the computational complexity to a higher level. It eliminates the need of additional parameters and it is more informative than the existing ones. The information provided by the Voronoi neighbors of an individual can be exploited to estimate the evolutionary state.

Unfortunately, the promising performance of CNNs can be achieved only when their architectures are optimally constructed. The architectures of state-of-the-art CNNs are typically handcrafted with extensive expertise in both CNNs and the investigated data, which consequently hampers the widespread adoption of CNNs for less experienced users. Evolutionary deep learning (EDL) is able to automatically design the best CNN architectures without much expertise. However, the existing EDL algorithms generally evaluate the fitness of a new architecture by training from scratch, resulting in the prohibitive computational cost even operated on high-performance computers. In this paper, an end-to-end offline performance predictor based on the random forest is proposed to accelerate the fitness evaluation in EDL. The proposed performance predictor shows the promising performance in term of the classification accuracy and the consumed computational resources when compared with 18 state-of-the-art peer competitors by integrating into an existing EDL algorithm as a case study.

This algorithm proposes to use a surrogate-based trust region local search method, a surrogate-guided GA (SGA) updating mechanism with a neighbor region partition strategy and a prescreening strategy based on the expected improvement infilling criterion of a simplified Kriging in the optimization process. The SGA updating mechanism is a special characteristic of the proposed algorithm. This mechanism makes a fusion between surrogates and the evolutionary algorithm. The neighbor region partition strategy effectively retains the diversity of the population. Moreover, multiple surrogates used in the SGA updating mechanism make the proposed algorithm optimize robustly. The proposed algorithm is validated by testing several high-dimensional numerical benchmark problems with dimensions varying from 30 to 100, and an overall comparison is made between the proposed algorithm and other optimization algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm is very efficient and promising for optimizing high-dimensional expensive problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2919762","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51825502); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51805180,51775216); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2018CFA078); Huazhong University of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2017QYTD04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8727511","High-dimensional expensive problems;multiple surrogates;prescreening strategy;simplified Kriging;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm;surrogate-guided crossover operation;trust region method","Optimization;Genetic algorithms;Evolutionary computation;Computational modeling;Prediction algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Search methods","genetic algorithms;search problems","generalized surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm;optimization algorithms;high-dimensional numerical benchmark problems;SGA updating mechanism;neighbor region partition strategy;surrogate-guided GA updating mechanism;surrogate-based trust region local search method;genetic algorithm;optimization framework;computationally expensive simulations;engineering optimization problems;high-dimensional expensive problems","","81","","77","IEEE","31 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most existing evolutionary algorithms encounter difficulties in dealing with MOPs whose Pareto optimal solutions are sparse (i.e., most decision variables of the optimal solutions are zero), especially when the number of decision variables is large. Such large-scale sparse MOPs exist in a wide range of applications, for example, feature selection that aims to find a small subset of features from a large number of candidate features, or structure optimization of neural networks whose connections are sparse to alleviate overfitting. This paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm for solving large-scale sparse MOPs. The proposed algorithm suggests a new population initialization strategy and genetic operators by taking the sparse nature of the Pareto optimal solutions into consideration, to ensure the sparsity of the generated solutions. Moreover, this paper also designs a test suite to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm for large-scale sparse MOPs. The experimental results on the proposed test suite and four application examples demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over seven existing algorithms in solving large-scale sparse MOPs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2918140","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672033,61822301,61876123,U1804262); State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries(grant numbers:PAL-N201805); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:1808085J06,1908085QF271); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8720021","Evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary neural network;feature selection;large-scale multiobjective optimization (MOP);sparse Pareto optimal solutions","Pareto optimization;Neural networks;Feature extraction;Evolutionary computation;Training;Sociology","genetic algorithms;Pareto optimisation;search problems","large-scale sparse multiobjective optimization problems;evolutionary computation community;evolutionary algorithms;Pareto optimal solutions;decision variables;structure optimization;sparse nature","","179","","81","IEEE","22 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, these methods cannot scale well to the modern deep neural networks due to the complicated architectures and large quantities of connection weights. In this paper, we propose a new method using genetic algorithms for evolving the architectures and connection weight initialization values of a deep convolutional neural network to address image classification problems. In the proposed algorithm, an efficient variable-length gene encoding strategy is designed to represent the different building blocks and the potentially optimal depth in convolutional neural networks. In addition, a new representation scheme is developed for effectively initializing connection weights of deep convolutional neural networks, which is expected to avoid networks getting stuck into local minimum that is typically a major issue in the backward gradient-based optimization. Furthermore, a novel fitness evaluation method is proposed to speed up the heuristic search with substantially less computational resource. The proposed algorithm is examined and compared with 22 existing algorithms on nine widely used image classification tasks, including the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the remarkable superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art designs in terms of classification error rate and the number of parameters (weights).","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2916183","Marsden Fund(grant numbers:VUW1209,VUW1509,VUW1615); Huawei Industry Fund(grant numbers:E2880/3663); Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:209862/3580,213150/3662); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61625204); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61803277); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8712430","Convolutional neural network (CNN);deep learning;genetic algorithms (GAs);image classification","Computer architecture;Architecture;Optimization;Genetic algorithms;Encoding;Task analysis;Convolutional neural networks","convolutional neural nets;genetic algorithms;gradient methods;image classification","backward gradient-based optimization;genetic algorithms;evolutionary paradigms;variable-length gene encoding strategy;image classification problems;connection weights;deep convolutional neural networks","","343","","57","IEEE","10 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
