To address these difficulties, this paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm assisted by two surrogates, one coarse model and one fine model. The coarse surrogate (CS) aims to guide the algorithm to quickly find a promising subregion in the search space, whereas the fine one focuses on leveraging good solutions according to the knowledge transferred from the CS. Since the obtained Pareto optimal solutions have not been validated using the real fitness function, a technique for generating the final optimal solutions is suggested. All achieved solutions during the whole optimization process are grouped into a number of clusters according to a set of reference vectors. Then, the solutions in each cluster are averaged and outputted as the final solution of that cluster. The proposed algorithm is compared with its three variants and two state-of-the-art offline data-driven multiobjective algorithms on eight benchmark problems to demonstrate its effectiveness. Finally, the proposed algorithm is successfully applied to an operational indices optimization problem in beneficiation processes.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2925959","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61525302,61590922); Project of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China(grant numbers:20171122-6); Projects of Shenyang(grant numbers:Y17-0-004); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:N160801001,N161608001); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1701104); Royal Society(grant numbers:IEC\NSFC\170279); Outstanding Student Research Innovation Project of Northeastern University(grant numbers:N170806003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8752044","Knowledge transfer;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs);multisurrogate;offline data-driven optimization","Optimization;Knowledge transfer;Task analysis;Data models;Sociology;Statistics;Evolutionary computation","evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation;search problems","optimization process;operational indices optimization problem;offline data-driven multiobjective optimization;knowledge transfer;evolutionary algorithm;coarse model;fine model;coarse surrogate;CS;Pareto optimal solutions;search space;fitness function","","26","","69","IEEE","1 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Inspired by transfer learning which can reuse past experiences to solve relevant tasks, many researchers pay more attention to explore how to learn from past optimization instances to accelerate the target one. In real-world applications, there have been numerous similar source instances stored in the database. The primary question is how to measure the transferability from numerous sources to avoid the notorious negative transferring. To obtain the relatedness between source and target instance, we develop an optimization instance representation method named centroid distribution, which is by the aid of the probabilistic model learned by elite candidate solutions in estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) during the evolutionary process. Wasserstein distance is employed to evaluate the similarity between the centroid distributions of different optimization instances, based on which, we present a novel framework called multisource selective transfer optimization with three strategies to select sources reasonably. To choose the suitable strategy, four selection suggestions are summarized according to the similarity between the source and target centroid distribution. The framework is beneficial to choose the most suitable sources, which could improve the search efficiency in solving multiobjective optimization problems. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and selection suggestions, we conduct two experiments: 1) comprehensive empirical studies on complex multiobjective optimization problem benchmarks and 2) a real-world SLOD problem. Suggestions for strategy selection coincide with the experiment results, based on which, we propose a mixed strategy to deal with the negative transfer in the experiments successfully. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves competitive performance on most of the benchmark problems in convergence speed and hypervolume values and performs best on the real-world applications among all the comparison algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2926107","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11725211,51675525); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8752421","Estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA);multiobjective optimization;multisource transfer;transfer optimization;Wasserstein distance (WD)","Optimization;Task analysis;Satellites;Search problems;Acceleration;Sociology;Statistics","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems","multisource selective transfer framework;multiobjective optimization problems;complex system design;similar search process;transfer learning;real-world applications;notorious negative transferring;optimization instance representation method;centroid distribution;distribution algorithm;multisource selective transfer optimization;selection suggestions;suitable sources;complex multiobjective optimization problem benchmarks;real-world SLOD problem;strategy selection coincide;negative transfer;benchmark problems;optimization instances;similar source instances;satellite layout optimization design;EDA;Wasserstein distance;hypervolume values;convergence speed","","9","","64","IEEE","1 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each binary classifier is composed of a binary tree and a linear support vector machine (SVM). The features extracted by the feature nodes and some of the function nodes of the tree are used to train the SVM. The decision made by the SVM is considered the decision of the corresponding classifier. During crossover and mutation, the SVM-weights are used to determine the usefulness of the corresponding nodes. We also use a fitness function based on Golub's index to select useful features. To discard less frequently used features, we employ unfitness functions for the feature nodes. We compare our method with 34 classification systems using 18 datasets.

Its two mutation operators have average time O(√n), where n is the number of vertices of the graph, while similar operators implemented by predecessor arrays, a typical tree data structure, have time O(n). Dynamic trees are also relevant when investigating tree representations since they have low time complexity, but there is no proper extension of them for EAs. Using aspects of both a dynamic tree and NDDR, namely, Euler tours and structural sharing, we propose a data structure called 2LETT, whose mutation operators have time O(√n) in the worst case. Experiments with the mutation operators using 2LETT, predecessor arrays, and NDDR are carried out for graphs with up to 300000 vertices. For a mutation operator that exchanges any two valid edges, predecessor arrays present the best performance for random trees with fewer than 10000 vertices; while 2LETT has the best performance for trees with more than 10000 vertices. Especially, noteworthy is the fact that 2LETT is the only structure whose running time is independent of tree diameter.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2928991","Funda????o Arauc??ria (Governo do Estado do Paran??); Coordena????o de Aperfei??oamento de Pessoal de N??vel Superior (CAPES); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8764437","Dynamic tree data structures;evolutionary algorithms (EAs);tree representations","Arrays;Tree data structures;Evolutionary computation;Time complexity;Sociology;Statistics","computational complexity;evolutionary computation;graph theory;optimisation;search problems;tree data structures;trees (mathematics)","direct spanning tree representation;mutation-based evolutionary algorithms;tree problems;efficient data structures;node-depth-degree representation;NDDR;mutation operator;average time;similar operators;tree diameter;structure whose running time;random trees;2LETT;structural sharing;low time complexity;investigating tree representations;dynamic tree;typical tree data structure;predecessor arrays","","1","","27","IEEE","16 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, a new newsvendor model is first proposed, which involves of both order quantity and selling price as decision variables. In this way, the newsvendor problem is reformulated as a mixed-variable nonlinear programming problem, rather than an integer linear programming problem as in previous investigations. In order to solve the mixed-variable newsvendor problem, a histogram model-based estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) called EDAmvn is developed, in which an adaptive-width histogram model is used to deal with the continuous variables and a learning-based histogram model is applied to deal with the discrete variables. The performance of EDAmvn was assessed on a test suite with eight representative instances generated by the orthogonal experiment design method and a real-world instance generated from real market data of Alibaba.

A key issue for analyzing the features of networks is to represent the characteristic information in the network with rationality. Network embedding, attracting plenty of attention recently, aims to convert network information into a low-dimensional space while maintaining the structure and properties of the network maximally. Most of the existing network embedding methods intend to preserve the pairwise relationship or similarity between nodes, but the community structure, which is one of the most important features of complex networks, is largely ignored. In this article, we propose a novel network embedding method based on evolutionary algorithm (EA), termed as EA-NECommunity, which can preserve both the local proximity of nodes and the community structure of the network by optimizing a carefully designed objective function. The number of communities in the network can be automatically determined without any prior knowledge. Moreover, taking the intrinsic properties of the network embedding problems in mind, we design a local search operator based on multidirectional search which can effectively find feasible solutions. In the experiments, we first visualize the embedding representation obtained by different algorithms, and then use the problems of node clustering, node classification, and link prediction to further validate the quality of the embedding representation obtained. The experimental results show that EA-NECommunity outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms on both the real life and synthetic networks.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2937455","General Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61773300); Key Program of Fundamental Research Project of Natural Science of Shaanxi Province, China(grant numbers:2017JZ017); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8813062","Community structure;dimension reduction;evolutionary algorithm;link prediction;network embedding;node classification;node clustering","Linear programming;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Complex networks;Clustering algorithms;Search problems;Prediction algorithms","complex networks;embedded systems;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern clustering;search problems","embedding representation;EA-NECommunity;synthetic networks;evolutionary network embedding preserving both local proximity;community structure;complex network;real-world application scenarios;characteristic information;network information;low-dimensional space;network embedding methods;evolutionary algorithm;local search operator","","4","","63","IEEE","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article presents an underestimation-assisted global and local cooperative DE to simultaneously enhance the effectiveness and efficiency. In the proposed algorithm, two phases, namely, the global exploration and the local exploitation, are performed in each generation. In the global phase, a set of trial vectors is produced for each target individual by employing multiple strategies with strong exploration capability. Afterward, an adaptive underestimation model with an self-adapted slope control parameter is proposed to evaluate these trial vectors, the best of which is selected as the candidate. In the local phase, the better-based strategies guided by individuals that are better than the target individual are designed. For each individual accepted in the global phase, multiple trial vectors are generated by using these strategies and filtered by the underestimation value. The cooperation between the global and local phases includes two aspects. First, both of them concentrate on generating better individuals for the next generation. Second, the global phase aims to locate promising regions quickly while the local phase serves as a local search for enhancing convergence. Moreover, a simple mechanism is designed to determine the parameter of DE adaptively in the searching process. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to predict the protein 3-D structure.

The difficulties in finding such solutions can be different. Although a number of evolutionary multimodal multiobjective algorithms (EMMAs) have been proposed, they are unable to solve such an MMOP due to their convergence-first selection criteria. They quickly converge to the Pareto optimal solutions which are easy to find and therefore lose diversity in the decision space. That is, such an MMOP features an imbalance between achieving convergence and preserving diversity in the decision space. In this article, we first present a set of imbalanced distance minimization benchmark problems. Then we propose an evolutionary algorithm using a convergence-penalized density method (CPDEA). In CPDEA, the distances among solutions in the decision space are transformed based on their local convergence quality. Their density values are estimated based on the transformed distances and used as the selection criterion. We compare CPDEA with five state-of-the-art EMMAs on the proposed benchmarks.

As a representative extension of the subgraph isomorphism problem, virtual network embedding (VNE) is a key problem in datacenter scheduling and network virtualization. Existing metaheuristic approaches to VNE problems tend to schedule networks as a whole. But when the problem scale grows, the performance of these approaches may degenerate due to the curse of dimensionality. In this article, we intend to propose a divide-and-conquer evolutionary algorithm with overlapping decomposition (ODEA) to solve large-scale VNE problems. First, realizing the fact that the decision variables in graph-based optimization problems like VNE are usually nonseparable, an overlapping decomposition method is introduced by investigating the characteristic of the network structure. In this method, the critical elements which have tight connections to many other nodes can belong to multiple subcomponents. As a result, the decision variables with tight connections can always be evolved together in multiple subcomponents. Second, to combine the subsolutions into a complete feasible solution, a competitive strategy is devised. Through the competition among critical elements, the optimizing information is shared among subcomponents, which can further improve the effectiveness of ODEA. The proposed ODEA can adopt different metaheuristics as the optimizer, and we conduct experiments on both the scenarios with a single virtual network and with a series of online networks. The experimental results verify that ODEA can significantly improve the performance of different metaheuristics in large-scale VNE problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2941824","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61622206,61976093,61873097); Science and Technology Plan Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B050502006); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation Research Team(grant numbers:2018B030312003); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:NRF-2019H1D3A2A01101977); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8850015","Graph matching;large-scale optimization;metaheuristics;virtual network embedding (VNE)","Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Substrates;Heuristic algorithms;Classification algorithms;Search problems;Bandwidth","computational complexity;computer centres;evolutionary computation;graph theory;network theory (graphs);optimisation;scheduling;virtualisation","large-scale virtual network embedding;divide-and-conquer evolutionary algorithm;online networks;single virtual network;complete feasible solution;multiple subcomponents;tight connections;critical elements;network structure;overlapping decomposition method;graph-based optimization problems;decision variables;large-scale VNE problems;ODEA;metaheuristic approaches;network virtualization;datacenter scheduling;NP-complete;nondeterministic polynomial-time complete;map subgraphs;subgraph isomorphism problem","","13","","51","CCBY","26 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Crowding methods have been developed to maintain population diversity, to investigate many peaks in parallel and to reduce genetic drift. We present the first rigorous runtime analyses of probabilistic crowding and generalized crowding, embedded in a (μ +1) EA. In probabilistic crowding the offspring compete with their parent in a fitness-proportional selection. Generalized crowding decreases the fitness of the inferior solution by a scaling factor during selection. We consider the bimodal function TwoMax and introduce a novel and natural notion for functions with bounded gradients. For a broad range of such functions we prove that probabilistic crowding needs exponential time with overwhelming probability to find solutions significantly closer to any global optimum than those found by random search. Even when the fitness function is scaled exponentially, probabilistic crowding still fails badly. Only if the exponential's base is linear in the problem size, probabilistic crowding becomes efficient on TwoMax. A similar threshold behavior holds for generalized crowding on TwoMax with respect to the scaling factor. Our theoretical results are accompanied by experiments for TwoMax showing that the threshold behaviors also apply to the best fitness found.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2914606","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog??a (CONACYT, the Mexican National Council for Science and Technology) registration(grant numbers:409151,264342); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8706706","Crowding methods;generalized crowding;probabilistic crowding;runtime analysis;theory","Probabilistic logic;Sociology;Statistics;Runtime;Optimization;Hamming distance;Genetics","evolutionary computation;genetic algorithms;probability;search problems","TwoMax;bimodal function;fitness-proportional selection;multimodal optimization;runtime analysis;generalized crowding;probabilistic crowding;crowding methods;real-world optimization problems","","11","","30","OAPA","6 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Infeasible offspring are repaired using projection onto the boundary of the feasibility region. Closed-form approximations are used for the one-generation progress of the evolution strategy. Approximate deterministic evolution equations are formulated for analyzing the strategy's dynamics. By iterating the evolution equations with the approximate one-generation expressions, the evolution strategy's dynamics can be predicted. The derived theoretical results are compared to experiments for assessing the approximation quality. It is shown that in the steady state the (μ/μI, λ)σSA-ES exhibits a performance as if the ES were optimizing a sphere model. Unlike the nonrecombinative (1, λ)-ES, the parental steady state behavior does not evolve on the cone boundary but stays away from the boundary to a certain extent.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2930316","Austrian Science Fund FWF(grant numbers:P29651-N32); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8770101","Conically constrained problem;evolution strategies (ESs);intermediate recombination;repair by projection","Maintenance engineering;Steady-state;Mathematical model;Optimization;Approximation algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Next generation networking","approximation theory;constraint handling;evolutionary computation;self-adjusting systems","conically constrained problem;theoretical performance analysis;σ-self-adaptation evolution strategy;σSA-ES;closed-form approximations;approximate deterministic evolution equations;approximation quality;nonrecombinative-ES;sphere model;evolution strategy","","","","12","IEEE","23 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Understanding Hypervolume Behavior Theoretically for Benchmarking in Evolutionary Multi/Many-Objective Optimization","H. K. Singh","School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Canberra, Australia","IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","29 May 2020","2020","24","3","603","610","Hypervolume (HV) is one of the most commonly used metrics for evaluating the Pareto front (PF) approximations generated by multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Even so, HV is a resultant of a complex interplay between the PF shape, number of objectives, and user-specified reference points which, if not well understood, may lead to misinformed inferences about benchmarking performance. In order to understand this behavior, some previous studies have investigated such interactions empirically. In this letter, a new and unconventional approach is taken for gaining further insights about HV behavior. The key idea is to develop theoretical formulas for certain linear (equilateral simplex) and quadratic (orthant) PFs in two specific orientations: 1) regular and 2) inverted. These PFs represent a large number of problems in the existing DTLZ and WFG suites commonly used for benchmarking. The numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the utility of the proposed work in benchmarking, and in understanding the contributions of the different regions of the PFs, such as corners, edges, as well explaining the contrast between the HV behaviors for regular versus inverted PFs. This letter provides a foundation and computationally fast means to undertake parametric studies to understand various aspects of HV.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2931191","Australian Research Council under Discovery(grant numbers:DP190102591); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8777109","Benchmarking;hypervolume (HV);many-objective optimization;multiobjective optimization","Benchmark testing;Optimization;Shape;Measurement;Evolutionary computation;Face;Decision making","approximation theory;evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation","hypervolume behavior;Pareto front approximations;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;PF shape;user-specified reference points;benchmarking performance;HV behavior","","3","","34","IEEE","26 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
