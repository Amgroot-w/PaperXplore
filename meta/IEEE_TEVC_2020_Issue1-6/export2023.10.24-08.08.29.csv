Despite their prevalence, large-scale dynamic optimization problems are not well studied in the literature. This paper is concerned with designing benchmarks and frameworks for the study of large-scale dynamic optimization problems. We start by a formal analysis of the moving peaks benchmark (MPB) and show its nonseparable nature irrespective of its number of peaks. We then propose a composite MPB suite with exploitable modularity covering a wide range of scalable partially separable functions suitable for the study of large-scale dynamic optimization problems. The benchmark exhibits modularity, heterogeneity, and imbalance features to resemble real-world problems. To deal with the intricacies of large-scale dynamic optimization problems, we propose a decomposition-based coevolutionary framework which breaks a large-scale dynamic optimization problem into a set of lower-dimensional components. A novel aspect of the framework is its efficient bi-level resource allocation mechanism which controls the budget assignment to components and the populations responsible for tracking multiple moving optima. Based on a comprehensive empirical study on a wide range of large-scale dynamic optimization problems with up to 200-D, we show the crucial role of problem decomposition and resource allocation in dealing with these problems. The experimental results clearly show the superiority of the proposed framework over three other approaches in solving large-scale dynamic optimization problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2902626","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFC0804002,2017YFC0804003); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/J017515/1,EP/P005578/1); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); Shenzhen Peacock Plan(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); Science and Technology Innovation Committee Foundation of Shenzhen(grant numbers:ZDSYS201703031748284); Program for University Key Laboratory of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017KSYS008); Royal Academy of Engineering(grant numbers:NRCP1617-6-125); RSSB-Funded(grant numbers:COF-INP-05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8657680","Computational resource allocation;cooperative coevolutionary (CC);decomposition;dynamic optimization problems;large-scale optimization problems;multipopulation","Optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Benchmark testing;Resource management;Power system dynamics;Sociology;Statistics","divide and conquer methods;evolutionary computation;optimisation;resource allocation;search problems","dynamic optimization problems;large-scale dynamic optimization problem;divide-and-conquer approach;decomposition-based coevolutionary framework;multiple moving optima tracking;lower-dimensional components;resource allocation;problem decomposition","","37","","90","IEEE","3 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It investigates how to solve multiple optimization problems (tasks) at the same time via evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to improve on the performance of solving each task independently, assuming if some component tasks are related then the useful knowledge (e.g., promising candidate solutions) acquired during the process of solving one task may assist in (and also benefit from) solving the other tasks. In EMTO, task relatedness is typically unknown in advance and needs to be captured via EA's population. Since the population of an EA can only cover a subregion of the solution space and keeps evolving during the search, thus captured task relatedness is local and dynamic. The multifactorial EA (MFEA) is one of the most representative EMTO techniques, inspired by the bio-cultural model of multifactorial inheritance, which transmits both biological and cultural traits from the parents to the offspring. MFEA has succeeded in solving various multitask optimization (MTO) problems. However, the intensity of knowledge transfer in MFEA is determined via its algorithmic configuration without considering the degree of task relatedness, which may prevent the effective sharing and utilization of the useful knowledge acquired in related tasks. To address this issue, we propose a self-regulated EMTO (SREMTO) algorithm to automatically adapt the intensity of cross-task knowledge transfer to different and varying degrees of relatedness between different tasks as the search proceeds so that the useful knowledge in common for solving related tasks can be captured, shared, and utilized to a great extent. We compare SREMTO with MFEA and its variants as well as the single-task optimization counterpart of SREMTO on two MTO test suites, which demonstrates the superiority of SREMTO.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2904696","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772393,61603299,61602385); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFB0802200); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2018ZDXM-GY-045); Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP160103595,LP180100114); Shenzhen Research and Development Foundation(grant numbers:JCYJ20170306153943097); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666053","Evolutionary algorithm (EA);knowledge transfer;multitask optimization (MTO);multitasking","Task analysis;Optimization;Knowledge transfer;Sociology;Statistics;Multitasking;Research and development","evolutionary computation;optimisation","cross-task knowledge transfer;MFEA;self-regulated evolutionary multitask optimization;self-regulated EMTO;multitask optimization problems;multifactorial EA;task relatedness;evolutionary algorithms;evolutionary computation;single-task optimization counterpart","","99","","32","IEEE","12 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our contribution aims at targeting the intensive and complex lower-level optimizations that occur when solving a large-scale and combinatorial bi-level problem. For this purpose, we consider hyper-heuristics through heuristic generation. Using a GP hyper-heuristic approach, we train greedy heuristics in order to make them more reliable when encountering unseen lower-level instances that could be generated during bi-level optimization. To validate our approach referred to as GA+AGH, we tackle instances from the bi-level cloud pricing optimization problem (BCPOP) that model the trading interactions between a cloud service provider and cloud service customers. Numerical results demonstrate the abilities of the trained heuristics to cope with the inherent nested structure that makes bi-level optimization problems so hard. Furthermore, it has been shown that training heuristics for lower-level optimization permits to outperform human-based heuristics and metaheuristics which constitute an excellent outcome for bi-level optimization.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2906581","Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg(grant numbers:9984150); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8671761","Bi-level optimization;genetic programming;hyper-heuristics;pricing in the cloud;Stackelberg games","Optimization;Cloud computing;Pricing;Linear programming;Decision making;Complexity theory;Genetic programming","computational complexity;genetic algorithms;search problems","lower-level optimization;heuristic generation;GP hyper-heuristic approach;greedy heuristics;bi-level cloud pricing optimization problem;bi-level optimization problems;combinatorial bi-level problems;genetic programming hyper-heuristic;NP-hard problem;GP hyper-heuristics","","20","","68","IEEE","20 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

I show how these factors represent movement patterns of a particle within a swarm and how they are affected by particle coefficients (i.e., inertia weight and acceleration coefficients). I derive equations that provide exact coefficient values to guarantee to achieve the desired movement pattern defined by these three factors within a swarm. I then relate these movements to the searching capability of particles and provide a guideline for designing potentially successful adaptive methods to control coefficients in particle swarm. Finally, I propose a new simple time adaptive particle swarm and compare its results with previous adaptive particle swarm approaches.

Given this observation, the motivation for this paper is to improve optimization performance through adaptive knowledge transfer across related problems. The scope for spontaneous transfers under the simultaneous occurrence of multiple problems unveils the benefits of multitasking. Multitask optimization has recently demonstrated competence in solving multiple (related) optimization tasks concurrently. Notably, in the presence of underlying relationships between problems, the transfer of high-quality solutions across them has shown to facilitate superior performance characteristics. However, in the absence of any prior knowledge about the intertask synergies (as is often the case with general black-box optimization), the threat of predominantly negative transfer prevails. Susceptibility to negative intertask interactions can impede the overall convergence behavior. To allay such fears, in this paper, we propose a novel evolutionary computation framework that enables online learning and exploitation of the similarities (and discrepancies) between distinct tasks in multitask settings, for an enhanced optimization process. Our proposal is based on the principled theoretical arguments that seek to minimize the tendency of harmful interactions between tasks, based on a purely data-driven learning of relationships among them. The efficacy of our proposed method is validated experimentally on a series of synthetic benchmarks, as well as a practical study that provides insights into the behavior of the method in the face of several tasks occurring at once.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2906927","Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology-Nanyang Technological University Joint Laboratory and Collaborative Research Programme on Complex Systems; National Research Foundation Singapore(grant numbers:AISG-RP-2018-00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8672822","Evolutionary multitasking;general optimization intelligence (GOI);intertask synergies;multifactorial optimization;online similarity learning","Optimization;Task analysis;Multitasking;Evolutionary computation;Knowledge transfer;Bayes methods;Machine learning","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;parameter estimation","evolutionary computation framework;convergence behavior;negative intertask interactions;predominantly negative transfer;intertask synergies;superior performance characteristics;high-quality solutions;multiple optimization tasks;multitask optimization;multiple problems;simultaneous occurrence;spontaneous transfers;adaptive knowledge transfer;optimization performance;MFEA-II;online transfer parameter estimation;multifactorial evolutionary algorithm;optimization process;multitask settings;distinct tasks;online learning","","190","","70","IEEE","22 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Otherwise, the reference point is set to the ideal point. In addition, the estimation of the nadir point is different from what was widely used in the literature. The nadir point, together with the ideal point, provides a feasible way to deal with dominance resistant solutions, which are difficult to be detected and eliminated in Pareto-based algorithms.

The experimental results show that it performs better than other algorithms in most of the test instances.

In the proposed ANDE algorithm, APC acts as a parameter-free automatic niching method that does not need to predefine the number of clusters or the cluster size. Also, it can facilitate locating multiple peaks without extra FEs. Furthermore, the ANDE algorithm is enhanced by a contour prediction approach (CPA) and a two-level local search (TLLS) strategy. First, the CPA is a predictive search strategy. It exploits the individual distribution information in each niche to estimate the contour landscape, and then predicts the rough position of the potential peak to help accelerate the convergence speed. Second, the TLLS is a solution refine strategy to further increase the solution accuracy after the CPA roughly predicting the peaks.

A framework of dynamic interval multiobjective cooperative co-evolutionary optimization based on the interval similarity is presented in this paper to handle DI-MOPs. In the framework, a strategy for decomposing decision variables is first proposed, through which all the decision variables are divided into two groups according to the interval similarity between each decision variable and interval parameters. Following that, two subpopulations are utilized to cooperatively optimize decision variables in the two groups. Furthermore, two response strategies, i.e., a strategy based on the change intensity and a random mutation strategy, are employed to rapidly track the changing Pareto front of the optimization problem. The proposed algorithm is applied to eight benchmark optimization instances as well as a multiperiod portfolio selection problem and compared with five state-of-the-art EAs.

In addition, replication-based task hardening can introduce new tasks, called replicas, into the system, enlarging the design space further. As a population-based global optimization algorithm, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been widely used to explore this huge design space over the last decade. However, as analyzed in this paper, the search space of previous works is highly redundant, resulting in poor efficiency and scalability. This paper proposes an efficient EA-based DSE method for the design of large-scale fault-tolerant multiprocessor systems. The main novelties of this paper include: 1) mapping exploration is explicitly separated, i.e., task mapping is optimized during the evolutionary search, while replica mapping is constructed heuristically according to the current co-synthesis state; 2) the design space of task hardening and task mapping are explored independently by a cooperative co-EA; and 3) as a complement to global search of EA, problem-specific local search operators are designed for both task hardening and task mapping, reducing the number of fitness evaluations required. Compared with the most relevant state-of-the-art method, the superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated using extensive experiments on a large set of benchmarks, e.g.,  $1.75\times \sim 2.50\times $  better results can be obtained on the benchmarks of 300 tasks and 30 processors.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2912726","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFC0804002); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91846111,91746209,617611360); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); Shenzhen Peacock Plan(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); Science and Technology Innovation Committee Foundation of Shenzhen(grant numbers:ZDSYS201703031748284,JCYJ20170817112421757,JCYJ20180504165652917); Program for University Key Laboratory of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017KSYS008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8695766","Bi-level optimization;cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm (CCEA);design space exploration (DSE);fault-tolerance;multiprocessor system;task mapping","Task analysis;Program processors;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Biological cells;Multiprocessing systems;Optimization","computational complexity;evolutionary computation;fault tolerant computing;genetic algorithms;multiprocessing systems;scheduling;search problems","evolutionary search;replica mapping;task mapping;problem-specific local search operators;design space exploration;NP-hard problems;replication-based task hardening;population-based global optimization algorithm;evolutionary algorithms;huge design space;search space;EA-based DSE method;large-scale fault-tolerant multiprocessor systems;task scheduling","","8","","43","OAPA","23 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Feature selection can be considered a multiobjective problem. However, it has its problematic characteristics, such as a highly discontinuous Pareto front, imbalance preferences, and partially conflicting objectives. These characteristics are not easy for existing evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms. We propose a new decomposition approach with two mechanisms (static and dynamic) based on multiple reference points under the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) framework to address the above-mentioned difficulties of feature selection. The static mechanism alleviates the dependence of the decomposition on the Pareto front shape and the effect of the discontinuity. The dynamic one is able to detect regions in which the objectives are mostly conflicting, and allocates more computational resources to the detected regions. In comparison with other EMO algorithms on 12 different classification datasets, the proposed decomposition approach finds more diverse feature subsets with better performance in terms of hypervolume and inverted generational distance. The dynamic mechanism successfully identifies conflicting regions and further improves the approximation quality for the Pareto fronts.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2913831","Marsden Fund(grant numbers:VUW1509,VUW1615); Huawei Industry(grant numbers:E2880/3663); Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:216378/3764); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8703157","Classification;feature selection;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D);multiobjective optimization;partially conflicting","Feature extraction;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Task analysis;Approximation algorithms;Sociology;Statistics","evolutionary computation;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);Pareto optimisation;pattern classification","multiple reference points-based decomposition;multiobjective feature selection;static mechanisms;dynamic mechanisms;machine learning;highly discontinuous Pareto front;evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;EMO algorithms;diverse feature subsets","","55","","47","IEEE","30 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The basic idea of the proposed method is to use different line segments only in the hypervolume contribution region for the hypervolume contribution approximation. Comparing with a traditional method which is based on the R2 indicator to approximate the hypervolume, the new method can directly approximate the hypervolume contribution and will utilize all the direction vectors only in the hypervolume contribution region. The new method, the traditional method, and the Monte Carlo sampling method together with two exact methods are compared through comprehensive experiments. Our results show the advantages of the new method over the other methods. Comparing with the other two approximation methods, the new method achieves the best performance for comparing hypervolume contributions of different solutions and identifying the solution with the smallest hypervolume contribution. Comparing with the exact methods, the new method is computationally efficient in high-dimensional spaces where the exact methods are impractical to use.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2909271","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876075); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); Shenzhen Peacock Plan(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); Science and Technology Innovation Committee Foundation of Shenzhen(grant numbers:ZDSYS201703031748284); Program for University Key Laboratory of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017KSYS008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8681657","Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO);hypervolume contribution;R2 indicator","Monte Carlo methods;Optimization;Nickel;Approximation methods;Sociology;Indexes","approximation theory;Monte Carlo methods;sampling methods","Monte Carlo sampling method;approximation methods;R2-based hypervolume contribution approximation;hypervolume contribution approximation method;hypervolume contribution region;high-dimensional spaces","","32","","23","IEEE","4 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
