It aims at balancing traffic demand against airspace capacity by scheduling aircraft, which is critical for air navigation service providers in delivering secure and sustainable air transport. Nowadays, the scale of scheduled aircraft grows dramatically along with the sharp increase in air traffic demand, which brings heavy pressure to efficient scheduling. Regarding safety and efficiency as two fundamental objectives of air transport, this paper proposes a cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm to solve large-scale multi-objective ATFM problems. First, a new multi-objective co-evolution framework with an evolving external archive is devised, in which the subcomponents collaborate with each other via the knee solution of the archive. Second, a novel fuzzy decomposition method is specifically designed to split the large-scale ATFM problem into small-size subcomponents by utilizing the spatiotemporal correlations of aircraft. During optimization, the proposed algorithm can continuously receive feedback from the optimization process and make the decomposition more likely better suited to the problem. Third, a new contribution-based probabilistic resource allocation mechanism is developed to automatically assign the computing resources to the unbalanced subcomponents. Finally, a test suite with different scales extracted from real air traffic data is created. Extensive experimental results show that, given the same number of fitness evaluations, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of effectiveness on all the benchmark instances.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3328886","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61722102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10302395","Multi-objective optimization;evolutionary computation;meta-heuristic;air traffic flow management","Aircraft;Airports;Metaheuristics;Delays;Aircraft navigation;Air traffic control;Trajectory","","","","","","","IEEE","31 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

As reinforcement learning is gradually used to optimize control, the time-consuming controller training makes soft robots design an expensive optimization problem. Although surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms have made a remarkable achievement in dealing with expensive optimization problems, they typically suffer from challenges in constructing accurate surrogate models due to the complex mapping among structure, control, and task performance. Therefore, we propose an action inheritance-based evolutionary algorithm to accelerate the design process. Instead of training a controller, the proposed algorithm uses inherited actions to control a candidate design to complete a task and obtain its approximated performance. Inherited actions are near-optimal control policies that are partially or entirely inherited from optimized control actions of a real evaluated robot design. The action inheritance plays the role of surrogate models where its input is the structure and output is the near-optimal control actions. We also propose a random perturbation operation to estimate the error introduced by inherited control actions. The effectiveness of our proposed method is validated by evaluating it on a wide range of tasks, including locomotion and manipulation. Experimental results show that our algorithm is better than the other three state-of-the-art algorithms on most tasks when only a limited computational budget is available. Compared with the algorithm without surrogate models, our algorithm saves about half the computing cost.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3327459","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976165,62376202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10296048","Soft robot design;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm;morphological optimization;error estimation","Robots;Optimization;Task analysis;Soft robotics;Training;Computational modeling;Encoding","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Quick online decomposition is still a challenging issue, along with solution reconstruction for new subproblems. This paper proposes transfer-based particle swarm optimization, which adopts a dynamic differential grouping for online decomposition and a solution transfer strategy in response to environmental changes. Particularly, once an environmental change occurs, the dynamic differential grouping readjusts historical groupings based on the change severity of variable interactions. In addition, according to the similarity between subproblems in successive environments, the solution transfer strategy constructs new solutions from historical ones through dimension mapping. Multiple swarms are created to explore subareas of subproblems. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on problem instances up to 1000-D in terms of solution optimality.

Therefore, it is essential to maintain the population diversity in cooperative coevolution. This work proposes a bi-population enhanced cooperative differential evolution to address this issue. In the proposed method, the population of a subproblem is divided into two subpopulations (local and global) according to a specific strategy. The global and local subpopulations evolve independently, using different differential mutation operators to generate offspring separately without interference. The local subpopulation aims to track and improve the previous optima, while the global subpopulation attempts to find and locate the potential emerging optima. The proposed algorithm is tested on 12 constrained large-scale benchmarks and the experiments show that it can provide highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

To address this issue, we propose three different benchmark functions in this paper based on NAS-Bench-101. Specifically, we first propose a correlation-based feature extraction method, to capture the accuracy relationship between neural architectures and their fitness values. Furthermore, we propose a function toolkit, which allows combining different architecture features to specific benchmark functions. In addition, three benchmark functions are derived upon the toolkit by considering the features of neural net topologies, the features of neural operations, and their combinations. Based on these designs, the search space partition and transition probability calculation could be easily established, which in turn greatly promote the runtime and convergence analysis.

It intends to improve the performance of evolutionary optimization on multiple problems via knowledge learning and transfer across them while the optimization processes progress online. Existing EMT paradigms can be classified as explicit EMT (EEMT) and implicit EMT (IEMT) according to the mechanisms adopted in the knowledge transfer. With additional knowledge learning and transfer modules, the EEMT often brings flexible algorithmic designs and effective knowledge transfer against the IEMT. However, most of the existing EEMT studies are designed for continuous optimization problems. Due to the difficulty of learning problem-specific mappings across combinatorial optimization problems, EEMT for combinatorial optimization is still in the nascent stage. Furthermore, it is worth noting that, with the growing number of tasks in today’s real-world applications and the enlarged number of decision variables in each of the tasks, learning mappings across tasks becomes more challenging. Keeping the above in mind, this paper presents a novel EEMT algorithm with centralized learning for solving the large-scale and multi-objective combinatorial optimization in many-task manner, in which knowledge transfer across tasks is conducted based on a centralized learning model, instead of task-specific mappings which are required in existing EEMT studies. To investigate the performance of the proposed centralized learning assisted EEMT, comprehensive empirical studies have been conducted on the large-scale and multi-objective knapsack problems. Lastly, the efficacy of our proposed method is further validated on a real-world combinatorial optimization application.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3323877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10278184","Evolutionary Multitasking;Combinatorial Optimization;Large-scale Optimization","Task analysis;Optimization;Knowledge transfer;Multitasking;Search problems;Companies;Evolutionary computation","","","","","","","IEEE","11 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We show that even on the simple m-objective generalization of the discrete OneMinMax benchmark, where every solution is Pareto optimal, the NSGA-II also with large population sizes cannot compute the full Pareto front (objective vectors of all Pareto optima) in sub-exponential time when the number of objectives is at least three. The reason for this unexpected behavior lies in the fact that in the computation of the crowding distance, the different objectives are regarded independently.

To tackle this issue, we suggest an effective surrogate modeling method for large-scale expensive optimization in this paper, where the models are built on a number of linear subspaces instead of the original search space. Specifically, a linear subspace is constructed by a pair of points/solutions which are generated based on the set of elite solutions.

In real-world applications, engineers typically construct complex features based on a combination of basic features, re-using those features as modules. However, modularity in evolutionary feature construction is still an open research topic. This paper tries to fill that gap by proposing a modular and hierarchical multitree genetic programming (GP) algorithm that allows trees to use the output values of other trees, thereby representing expressive features in a compact form. Based on this new representation, we propose a macro parent-repair strategy to reduce redundant and irrelevant features, a macro crossover operator to preserve interactive features, and an adaptive control strategy for crossover and mutation rates to dynamically balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. A comparison with seven bloat control methods on 98 regression datasets shows that the proposed modular representation achieves significantly better results in terms of test performance and smaller model size. Experimental results on the state-of-the-art symbolic regression benchmark demonstrate that the proposed symbolic regression method outperforms 22 existing symbolic regression and machine learning algorithms, providing empirical evidence for the superiority of the modularized evolutionary feature construction method.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3318638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10261487","Evolutionary forest;random forest;genetic programming;evolutionary feature construction;modularity","Genetic programming;Task analysis;Semantics;Random forests;Machine learning algorithms;Computational modeling;Contracts","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To solve this problem, we propose a dynamic-niching-based Pareto domination, called DNPD, which adds a dynamic niche to constrain the tranditional Pareto dominantion to achieve a balance of convergence and diversity of population in the decision space. In the early stage of the algorithm, the smaller niche makes the algorithm retain a large number of well-distributed individuals. In the later stage of the algorithm, the dynamically increased niche accelerates the convergence of the population. DNPD can be integrated into the Pareto-dominance-based algorithms to solve MMOPs.

Over the last two decades, archiving, the process of comparing new solutions with previous ones and deciding how to update the archive/population, stands as an important issue in evolutionary multi-objective optimisation (EMO). This is evidenced by constant efforts from the community on developing various effective archiving methods, ranging from conventional Pareto-based methods to more recent indicator-based and decomposition-based ones. However, the focus of these efforts is on empirical performance comparison in terms of specific quality indicators; there is lack of systematic study of archiving methods from a general theoretical perspective. In this paper, we attempt to conduct a systematic overview of multi-objective archiving, in the hope of paving the way to understand archiving algorithms from a holistic perspective of theory and practice, and more importantly providing a guidance on how to design theoretically desirable and practically useful archiving algorithms. In doing so, we also present that archiving algorithms based on weakly Pareto compliant indicators (e.g., -indicator), as long as designed properly, can achieve the same theoretical desirables as archivers based on Pareto compliant indicators (e.g., hypervolume indicator).

Such penetration introduces various uncertain factors, such as renewable energy, energy storage, and electric vehicles, making it difficult for traditional mathematical methods to find effective solutions. However, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have shown good performance in solving this problem. Therefore, in this paper, a self-adaptive collaborative differential evolution algorithm (SADEA) is proposed to solve the ERM problem under uncertainty. In SADEA, a three-stage adaptive collaboration strategy, includes boundary randomization stage, knowledge-assisted collaboration stage, and range restructuration stage, is used to generate collaborative solutions. The collaborative solutions generated in the above stages will jointly participate in the perturbation of DE strategies to explore promising solutions. In addition, different DE strategies are selected according to count values and random factors. At the end of the algorithm, boundary control, elite selection and retention are used to ensure the legitimacy and robustness of solutions. The proposed SADEA is compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms on a real-world distribution network located in Salamanca, Spain. The results show that SADEA is superior to its competitors in terms of the objective function, ranking index, and convergence.

Accordingly, generative models (e.g., generative adversarial network (GAN)) are typically used to synthesize the visual samples conditioned by the class semantic vectors and achieve remarkable progress for ZSL. However, existing GAN-based generative ZSL methods are based on hand-crafted models, which cannot adapt to various datasets/scenarios and fails to model instability. To alleviate these challenges, we propose evolutionary generative adversarial network search (termed EGANS) to automatically design the generative network with good adaptation and stability, enabling reliable visual feature sample synthesis for advancing ZSL. Specifically, we adopt cooperative dual evolution to conduct a neural architecture search for both generator and discriminator under a unified evolutionary adversarial framework. EGANS is learned by two stages: evolution generator architecture search and evolution discriminator architecture search. During the evolution generator architecture search, we adopt a many-to-one adversarial training strategy to evolutionarily search for the optimal generator. Then the optimal generator is further applied to search for the optimal discriminator in the evolution discriminator architecture search with a similar evolution search algorithm. Once the optimal generator and discriminator are searched, we entail them into various generative ZSL baselines for ZSL classification. Extensive experiments show that EGANS consistently improve existing generative ZSL methods on the standard CUB, SUN, AWA2 and FLO datasets.

The former represents the manifold structure learned from the population, in accordance with the regularity property of multiobjective optimization problems, while the latter represents the noise or uncertainty that can be embedded in the learned manifold structure.

It provides a normative account for the changes in ties within interaction networks in response to the behaviour of social partners. While considerable efforts have explored the role of partner selection in fostering cooperation, there remains a limited understanding of how agents learn to establish effective interaction patterns and adapt their connections accordingly. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leverage recent advancements in reinforcement learning and propose an adaptive interaction mechanism to investigate self-organization behaviour in the iterated prisoner’s dilemma game. Within this framework, artificial agents are trained using a self-regarding Roth-Erev algorithm, utilizing reputation as a dynamic signal to update their willingness to engage with neighbours. Additionally, these agents are endowed with the capability to sever inactive connections. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing reinforcement learning and local information from reputation to capture the dynamics of interactions. Notably, we discover that the entangled coevolution of strategy and interaction network can facilitate the emergence and maintenance of cooperation, despite the optimal tolerance threshold for ineffective neighbours varying depending on the strength of the social dilemma. Furthermore, the emerging network topology presented in this work accurately captures the assortative mixing pattern observed in previous experiments and realistic evidence. Finally, we validate the simulation results through theoretical analysis and confirm the robustness of the proposed mechanism across populations of varying sizes and initial structures.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3304911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10215365","","Games;Statistics;Sociology;Heuristic algorithms;Simulation;Task analysis;Intelligent agents","","","","","","","IEEE","14 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Recent structural network control principles have introduced a new approach to discover PDTs by selecting an optimal set of driver genes in personalized gene interaction network (PGIN). However, most of current methods only focus on controlling the system through a minimum driver-node set and ignore the existence of multiple candidate driver-node sets for therapeutic drug target identification in PGIN. Therefore, this paper proposed multi-objective optimization-based structural network control principles (MONCP) by considering minimum driver nodes and maximum prior-known drug-target information. To solve MONCP, a discrete multi-objective optimization problem is formulated with many constrained variables, and a novel evolutionary optimization model called LSCV-MCEA was developed by adapting a multi-tasking framework and a rankings-based fitness function method. With genomics data of patients with breast or lung cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, the effectiveness of LSCV-MCEA was validated. The experimental results indicated that compared with other advanced methods, LSCV-MCEA can more effectively identify PDTs with the highest Area Under the Curve score for predicting clinically annotated combinatorial drugs. Meanwhile, LSCV-MCEA can more effectively solve MONCP than other evolutionary optimization methods in terms of algorithm convergence and diversity. Particularly, LSCV-MCEA can efficiently detect disease signals for individual patients with BRCA cancer.

It challenges evolutionary algorithms in allocating fitness evaluations to the minimization of constraint violations and the optimization of objectives. Most existing evolutionary algorithms implement fixed allocation schemes by using non-priority, priority, or priority-complete comparison criteria. This paper argues that different constrained optimization problems should be solved by algorithms with a dynamic allocation scheme, and the key to adjusting the allocation scheme is a judgement on whether the objective optimization or the constraint violation minimization is beneficial to finding the optimum. In this paper, correlations between objectives and constraints are measured for the judgement. Based on the correlations, a dynamic allocation scheme for fitness evaluations is proposed for constrained evolutionary algorithms. The objective priority criterion or the objective priority-complete criterion is dynamically selected to allocate more fitness evaluations to the objective optimization if the optimization of objectives is beneficial. Otherwise, the constraint priority criterion or the constraint priority-complete criterion is selected to allocate fitness evaluations. Experimental results show that algorithms with the selected criterion significantly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of attaining feasible solutions with better objective values. Furthermore, algorithms with the dynamic allocation scheme have the advantage of consistently finding feasible solutions with better objective values than algorithms based on non-beneficial, fixed, and randomly selected schemes. The results demonstrate the positive impact of the correlation-based dynamic allocation scheme on evolutionary algorithms for solving constrained optimization problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3302897","the Natural Science Research Project of Department of Education of Guizhou Province(grant numbers:QJJ2023012,QJJ2023061); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2020ZYGXZR014); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61906069,62276103); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A1515010696,2022A1515011491); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10210690","Dynamic allocation;correlations between objectives and constraints;evolutionary algorithm;priority comparison criteria;constrained optimization","Resource management;Optimization;Minimization;Correlation;Search problems;Heuristic algorithms;Sociology","","","","","","","IEEE","8 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To be more specific, an adaptively switching strategy analyzing the correlation between the objective optimization direction and constraint satisfaction direction is designed to determine whether to build the constraint surrogate models to assist the current evolutionary search. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm contains two search modes: 1) unconstrained surrogate-assisted search mode and 2) constrained surrogate-assisted search mode.

Thus, this paper proposes a novel Virtual Sample Generation approach based on genetic algorithm (GA) combing with Information Gain and Acceptance-rejection Sampling, abbreviated as VSG3A2. First, this work develops the ARS-VAD subalgorithm, by integrating the acceptance rejection sampling method into the crossover and mutation operations of GA. The algorithm ensures that the distribution of offspring attribute values is close to the distribution of original samples at attribute level. Second, this work presents the IG-VSS subalgorithm, which is combined with the idea of minimizing absolute information gain, to find the optimal offspring sample as a virtual sample in each loop, ensuring the authenticity of virtual samples at the sample level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces the concept of information gain into VSG. Extensive experiments on four public datasets from various fields fully demonstrate that the VSG3A2 is more competitive than six state-of-the-art VSG approaches. The MAE, the RMSE and the MAPE metrics of prediction models, trained on virtual samples generated by the proposed VSG3A2, are reduced at least by 19.78%, 19.56%, 20.16% on average than that of the best compared VSG approach, respectively.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3298703","Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing(grant numbers:cstc2022ycjh-bgzxm0004); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62136002, 62233018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10194332","Virtual sample generation;genetic algorithms;acceptance-rejection sampling method;information gain;small sample learning","Genetic algorithms;Data models;Task analysis;Knowledge based systems;Interpolation;Industries;Sampling methods","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, introducing conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), we use only one surrogate model to effectively fit such a set valued mapping, which extracts knowledge from lower-level optimal vectors corresponding to the same upper-level vector. Then, a BLMOP is transformed into a single-level constraint multiobjective optimization problem (CMOP). By adaptively allocating computational resources to optimize the CMOP, promising upper-level vectors are obtained. Furthermore, a lower-level search is executed for these promising upper-level vectors, thus obtaining high-quality solutions.

Evolutionary clustering has found many successful applications, but all the results are empirical, lacking theoretical support. This paper fills this gap by proving that the approximation performance of the GSEMO (a simple multi-objective evolutionary algorithm) for solving four formulations of clustering, i.e., k-tMM, k-center, discrete k-median and k-means, can be theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, we consider clustering under fairness, which tries to avoid algorithmic bias, and has recently been an important research topic in machine learning.

Specifically, a prefix notation is used as program representation on the GPU device side, and column-major storage is used for the training dataset on the device side to achieve coalesced global memory access on the GPU. The evaluation of multiple GP programs in each generation can be simultaneous, which increases the parallelism of the algorithm. In addition, a parallel reduction is performed to maximize the use of the powerful parallel computing capability of GPU devices. Furthermore, the hoist mutation is also added to the proposed approach to help eliminate stack overflow on the device side. We compare training time and classification accuracy on various datasets with several GP and non-GP approaches. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach significantly speeds up the existing GP-based binary image classification approaches without degradation in classification accuracy.

By transforming the MOP into a MTOP, not only that the difficulty in handling conflicting objectives can be avoided, but also that MTO can help efficiently find well-distributed multiple optimal solutions for MOP. With the above idea, this paper proposes a new multiobjective optimization method via MTO, with the following three contributions. Firstly, a theorem is proposed to theoretically show the relationship between MOP and MTOP and how MOP can be transformed into a MTOP. Secondly, based on the theoretical analysis, a multiple tasks for multiple objectives (MTMO) framework is proposed for solving MOP efficiently. Thirdly, a MTMO-based evolutionary algorithm is developed to solve MOP, together with two novel strategies. One is a target point estimation strategy for transforming the MOP into a MTOP automatically and accurately. The other is an archive-based implicit knowledge transfer strategy for efficiently transferring knowledge across multiple tasks to enhance the optimization results of multiple tasks together. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is validated in extensive experiments on 15 MOPs with objective numbers varying from 3 to 20 and with six state-of-the-art algorithms as competitors.

Such optimization problems can be called expensive incremental optimization problems (EIOPs). Despite their importance, EIOPs have not attracted much attention over the past few years. Since the objectives of different design stages are different but related, reusing the search experience from the past design stages is beneficial to the evolutionary search of the current design stage. Therefore, a surrogate-assisted differential evolution with knowledge transfer (SADE-KT) is proposed in this work, which aims to fill the current gap in solving EIOPs. The major merit of the proposed SADE-KT is its ability to seamlessly integrate knowledge transfer and the surrogate-assisted evolutionary search. In SADE-KT, a surrogate based hybrid knowledge transfer strategy is first proposed. This strategy makes it possible to reuse the knowledge captured from the past design stages by leveraging different knowledge transfer techniques. As a result, the convergence for the current design stage can be speeded up. Then, a two-level surrogate-assisted evolutionary search is developed to search for the optimum.

Although EMTO has received significant interest, rare studies consider handling tasks that are multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) with multiple global optimal solutions. Due to the multiple different modalities of each task, a major challenge of solving multiple MMOPs is how to extract and transfer knowledge across modalities of different tasks. To this end, this paper designs a distributed knowledge transfer based evolutionary multitask multimodal optimization (EMTMO-DKT) approach for solving multiple MMOPs simultaneously by discovering and utilizing local knowledge across modalities of different tasks. Specifically, we first divide the population of each task into multiple subpopulations, where each subpopulation explores a modality. Then, we propose an evolution path based similarity measurement to measure the local similarities between subpopulations of different tasks. Since the modalities can be locally similar across tasks, we develop a subpopulation cross matching strategy according to the obtained similarities to pair subpopulations of different tasks. In this stage, the successfully paired subpopulations are allowed to transfer knowledge. Finally, the knowledge transfer probability self-adjusting strategy is applied to each subpopulation to balance knowledge transfer and self-evolution, so as to improve search efficiency. In this paper, a set of multitask multimodal optimization test problems are constructed to assess the efficacy of compared algorithms. Experimental results on both the benchmark functions and the real-world optimization problem demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can quickly locate more global optima in comparison with state-of-the-art EMTO and multimodal optimization algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3291874","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61988101); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3304700); Science and Technology Program of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:2022JH6/100100055); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10171983","Evolutionary multi-task optimization;multimodal optimization;local similarity;knowledge transfer","Optimization;Task analysis;Knowledge transfer;Statistics;Sociology;Search problems;Multitasking","","","","","","","IEEE","3 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Furthermore, the EGNA baseline learns a GBN at each iteration based on the best individuals in the last iteration, which may lead to local optimum convergence or large variance between solutions across multiple independent runs of the algorithm.

During the process of solving DMOPs, tracking the constantly changing Pareto optimal set (POS) quickly is the main task, and numerous methods have been proposed to achieve this task from different perspectives. However, how to improve the evolution of static optimizers via using historical information from past environments gets little attention. In fact, with adequate historical evolution information to learn, the trend of population evolution in the historical environments is promising to guide the future evolution and thus enhance the search ability. Therefore, in this paper, a historical evolution learning based framework is proposed to assist the static optimizers in fully using the historical evolution direction and POSs distribution. Specifically, two new models are designed with a purpose of generating offsprings and environmental selection, respectively. For enhancing the contribution of offsprings, a direction guidance model is developed to guide the offsprings according to the direction tendency of historical evolution. Furthermore, to improve the robustness of static optimizers and avoid the disturbance caused by misleading solutions, a manifold revise model is proposed to produce promising solutions via consulting historical POSs distribution. The proposed framework employs these two models collaboratively, and it is flexible and readily to be embedded into various dynamic response mechanisms and static optimizers in coping with DMOPs. The superiority of the framework has been comprehensively demonstrated by experimental comparison results on a variety of benchmark test problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3290485","Program for Science & Technology Innovation Teams in Universities of Henan Province(grant numbers:23IRTSTHN010); Training Program of Young Backbone Teachers in Colleges and Universities in Henan Province(grant numbers:2020GGJS006); Program for Science & Technology Innovation Talents in Universities of Henan Province(grant numbers:23HASTIT023); Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province(grant numbers:222300420088); National Natural Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars of China(grant numbers:61922072); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976237,62106230,62176238,62206255); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10167726","Dynamic multiobjective optimization;Evolutionary algorithm;Historical learning;Framework;Offspring Guidance","Statistics;Sociology;Optimization;Manifolds;Task analysis;Robustness;Evolutionary computation","","","","1","","","IEEE","28 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, most existing prediction methods are manually designed learning models. These methods consider only macroscopic data while ignoring mesoscopic data that also have a significant impact on product quality. Thus, they are often poor at accuracy and generalization performance in practice. To address this issue, a multi-objective convolutional neural networks ensemble learning method with multi-scale data fusion (MOCNNEL-MSDF) is developed. Using data fusion of macro/meso data derived from kinetic models, MOCNNEL-MSDF first evolves a swarm of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by knowledge-transferring based reproduction and adaptive weights initialization adjustment to improve learning performance, and then a sparse ensemble approach based on differential evolution is applied to achieve the final prediction model from the evolved CNNs. Experimental results on both benchmark data and practical data of continuous annealing show that MOCNNEL-MSDF achieves competitive or better accuracy and robustness compared with other powerful learning methods, and outperforms the existing strip quality prediction models. The proposed method can be used in the product quality modeling of each process in the iron and steel industry, where it is desirable to combine mechanism models with production process data to construct a product quality prediction model with higher accuracy and generalization.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3290172","the Major Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72192830, 72192831); 111 Project(grant numbers:B16009); the Fund for the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62073067); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10167823","Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm;ensemble learning;convolutional neural network;quality prediction","Predictive models;Data models;Quality assessment;Product design;Ensemble learning;Production;Iron","","","","3","","","IEEE","28 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, the difficulty of the reference point specification in hypervolume-based EMO algorithms is circumvented by using two reference points. Instead of using only a single reference point, we propose a new hypervolume-based EMO algorithm that can effectively utilize two reference points cooperatively.

Therefore, this study proposed a surrogate and autoencoder-assisted multitask particle swarm optimization algorithm. First, an autoencoder-embedded multitask evolutionary framework was established to transform a high-dimensional multimodal optimization problem into multiple low-dimensional subproblems or subtasks.

Deep learning-based knowledge tracing (DLKT) achieves superb performance in terms of prediction accuracy, but it lacks of explainability, which makes us hard to trust or understand models. The previous work on explaining DLKT was mainly based on gradients or attention scores, which is susceptible to spurious correlations, reducing the credibility of the explanation. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a causal explanation method based on the genetic algorithm (GA), named Genetic Causal Explainer(GCE), which constructs a causal framework to estimate the attribution of subsequence to the predictions of DLKT models, and a genetic coding system is designed. Further, A multi-strategy initialization method inspired by domain prior knowledge is proposed, and a global empirical matrix is introduced to capture the causal correlation knowledge during the search process across instances, and guiding the mutation operators. The GCE as a post hoc explanation method can generate explanation results without affecting model training, and can be applied to analyze different DLKT models. Experimental results demonstrate the GCE perform better than other explanation methods in terms of accuracy and readability in quantitative assessments. Meanwhile, the GCE also shows good application prospects in mining educational laws and comparing KT models.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3286666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10153769","knowledge tracing;explanation method;genetic algorithm;cause-effect","Predictive models;Neural networks;Analytical models;Deep learning;Correlation;Data models;Knowledge engineering","","","","","","","IEEE","15 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To solve these problems, this article proposes a multiform optimization framework to solve a multi-objective feature selection task together with several auxiliary single-objective feature selection tasks in a multitask environment. The proposed framework uses the problem-solving experience of single-objective tasks to assist the multi-objective feature selection task in exploring more promising regions and accelerating the convergence speed. Specifically, a knowledge transfer strategy based on the search experience of different tasks is developed to accomplish multiform optimization. In addition, a diversity enhancement mechanism is presented to improve search ability in promising decision space areas by considering historical information about the population.

However, most existing GP-based image classification methods often have a complex tree/program structure and a large search space, which may lead to poor performance. To address this, this paper develops a two-stage-based GP approach to automatically evolving solutions/ensembles for image classification. In the new approach, the process of constructing an image classification solution is divided into two stages, i.e., evolving small building blocks for feature extraction and evolving ensembles of classifiers by reusing these blocks. Accordingly, at each stage, a simple tree structure can be designed to facilitate the search. In the first stage, a simple block representation and a new search mechanism including a population updating strategy are developed to evolve diverse and effective blocks. In the second stage, a small set of diverse blocks are selected and transformed into primitives, which produces a new tree representation to evolve ensembles of classifiers for image classification. The new designs allow the proposed approach to construct sufficiently but not over complex solutions for difficult tasks by using/searching small trees. The new approach outperforms most GP-based and non-GP-based comparison methods on five image datasets including CIFAR10, Fashion_MNIST and SVHN.

While Bayesian optimization was developed for centralized optimization, the availability of massive distributed data has attracted increased interests in exploring federated Bayesian optimization that can use data on multiple clients without leaking the raw data. However, existing federated Bayesian optimization (FBO) approaches assume that either all clients jointly solve the same optimization task, or only one client solves one target optimization task by transferring knowledge from others in a federated way, making them unsuited for many real-world applications. In this paper, we consider FBO for the scenario where multiple related local black-box tasks associated with different clients are jointly optimized by sharing knowledge between tasks without leaking the data privacy. An efficient federated many-task Bayesian optimization framework is proposed to address not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data while protecting the data privacy in the federated setting. A novel federated knowledge transfer paradigm is developed for dynamic many-task model aggregation according to a dissimilarity matrix. The dissimilarity is measured based on the rank of the predictions and only the hyperparameters in the local Gaussian process models are shared. In addition, a federated ensemble acquisition function is constructed by integrating the predictions of two surrogates using the global and local hyperparameters, respectively, to effectively search for the optimal solution.

In addition, we consider two conflicting objectives, which are minimizing the total flight delays and conflicts between flights, where the conflicts depend on the flight 4D trajectories (3D position plus time). To solve this new challenging problem, we propose a novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with new problem-specific individual representation and search operators. Specifically, the multi-chromosomes encoding scheme is designed to adapt to different types of operations. Then, to search the huge search space effectively, we develop a hybrid crossover operator that recombines the parents based on their flight routes. Furthermore, to balance the exploration and exploitation, we develop a new mutation strategy to utilize the heterogeneous search potential of different individuals. For exploitation, the knee individual in the Pareto front is improved by a new time shift operator for exploitation, and other non-dominated solutions are mutated by fixed-route mutation. For exploration, the dominated solutions are mutated randomly. To verify the effectiveness, we compare it with the real air traffic flow management schedules and the state-of-the-art algorithms on a range of real-world air traffic datasets.

To this end, we propose the SPESS approach which is a sparsity preserved evolutionary algorithm for subset selection. To be specific, we design two sparsity preserved operators (i.e., sparsity preserved crossover operator and sparsity preserved mutation operator), which can be used in SPESS to ensure the sparsity of the generated solutions in the process of Pareto optimization. The main advantages of the proposed sparsity preserved operators are that they can obtain high quality solutions and improve the search efficiency of the algorithm.

Conventional SR suffers from two fundamental issues which we address here. First, these methods search the space stochastically (typically using genetic programming) and hence do not necessarily find the best function. Second, the criteria used to select the equation optimally balancing accuracy with simplicity have been variable and subjective. To address these issues we introduce Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), which systematically and efficiently considers all possible equations—made with a given basis set of operators and up to a specified maximum complexity— and is therefore guaranteed to find the true optimum (if parameters are perfectly optimised) and a complete function ranking subject to these constraints. We implement the minimum description length principle as a rigorous method for combining these preferences into a single objective. To illustrate the power of ESR we apply it to a catalogue of cosmic chronometers and the Pantheon+ sample of supernovae to learn the Hubble rate as a function of redshift, finding 40 functions (out of 5.2 million trial functions) that fit the data more economically than the Friedmann equation.

In the EC algorithm, there is a huge amount of data generated during the evolutionary process. These data reflect the evolutionary behavior and therefore mining and utilizing these data can obtain promising knowledge for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of EC algorithms to better solve optimization problems. Considering this and inspired by the ability of human beings that acquire knowledge from the historical successful experiences of their predecessors, this paper proposes a novel EC paradigm, named knowledge learning EC (KLEC). The KLEC aims to learn from historical successful experiences to obtain a knowledge library and to guide the evolutionary behaviors of individuals based on the knowledge library. The KLEC includes two main processes named “learning from experiences to obtain knowledge” and “utilizing knowledge to guide evolution”. First, KLEC maintains a knowledge library model and updates this model by learning the successful experiences collected in every generation. Second, KLEC not only adopts the evolutionary operation but also utilizes the knowledge library model to guide individuals for better evolution. The KLEC is a generic and effective framework, and we propose two algorithm instances of KLEC, which are knowledge learning-based differential evolution and knowledge learning-based particle swarm optimization. Also, we combine the knowledge learning framework with several state-of-the-art EC algorithms, showing that the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms can be significantly enhanced by incorporating the knowledge learning framework.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3278132","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2102102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10130069","Evolutionary computation;knowledge learning;differential evolution;particle swarm optimization;neural network;knowledge library","Libraries;Behavioral sciences;Particle swarm optimization;Data mining;Knowledge engineering;Statistics;Sociology","","","","","","","CCBY","19 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To this end, this paper designs a random contrastive interaction (RCI) strategy for PSO, resulting in RCI-PSO, to tackle large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs) effectively and efficiently. Unlike existing interaction mechanisms for low-dimensional problems, RCI randomly chooses several different peers from the current swarm to construct a random interaction topology for each particle. Then, it lets the particle interact with the selected peers based on their current evolutionary information instead of their historical evolutionary information. Within the topology, RCI only propagates the evolutionary information of two contrastive dominators with the largest difference in fitness to direct the evolution of the particle. Therefore, particles with no more than two dominators in their topologies are not updated. Furthermore, a dynamic topology size adjustment scheme is devised to gradually enlarge the interaction topology. In this way, the swarm gradually switches from exploring the immense search space dispersedly to exploiting the found optimal regions intensively as the evolution continues. With these two strategies, RCI-PSO expectedly compromises search diversity and search convergence well at the swarm level and the particle level. At last, extensive experiments executed on two public LSOP suites verify that RCI-PSO performs competitively with or even much better than totally 40 state-of-theart large-scale approaches and preserves a good capability and scalability in tackling complex LSOPs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3277501","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62006124,U20B2061); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2021H1D3A2A01082705); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20200811); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10129112","High Dimensional Problems;Large-Scale Optimization;Particle Swarm Optimization;Random Contrastive Interaction;Adaptive Topology","Topology;Optimization;Convergence;Particle swarm optimization;Scalability;Correlation;Structural rings","","","","2","","","IEEE","18 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, QD approaches struggle in the presence of uncertainty in the environment, as it impacts their ability to quantify the true performance and novelty of solutions. This problem has been highlighted multiple times independently in previous literature. In this work, we propose to uniformise the view on this problem through four main contributions. First, we formalise a common framework for uncertain domains: the Uncertain QD setting, a special case of QD in which fitness and descriptors for each solution are no longer fixed values but distribution over possible values. Second, we propose a new methodology to evaluate Uncertain QD approaches, relying on a new per-generation sampling budget and a set of existing and new metrics specifically designed for Uncertain QD. Third, we propose three new Uncertain QD algorithms: Archive-sampling, Parallel-Adaptivesampling and Deep-Grid-sampling. We propose these approaches taking into account recent advances in the QD community toward the use of hardware acceleration that enable large numbers of parallel evaluations and make sampling an affordable approach to uncertainty. Our final and fourth contribution is to use this new framework and the associated comparison methods to benchmark existing and novel approaches. We demonstrate once again the limitation of MAP-Elites in uncertain domains and highlight the performance of the existing Deep-Grid approach, and of our new algorithms.

On the other hand, indicators have been developed for a priori methods, where the DM provides preference information before optimization. In the literature, some studies treat interactive evolutionary methods as a series of a priori steps when assessing and comparing them. In such settings, indicators designed for a priori methods can be utilized. In this paper, we propose a novel performance indicator for interactive evolutionary multiobjective optimization methods and show how it can assess the performance of these interactive methods as a whole process and not as a series of separate steps.

To overcome it, this paper proposes an evolutionary method to learn sparse sharing representations adaptively. By embedding the neural network optimization into evolutionary multitasking, our proposed method finds an optimal combination of tasks and sharing features. It can identify negative correlation and redundant features and then remove them from the hidden feature set. Thus, an optimal sparse sharing subnetwork can be produced for each task.

To avoid getting trapped in local optimal feasible regions or a part of the global optimal feasible regions, a constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (CMOEA) should consider both the escape force and the expansion force carefully during the search process. However, most CMOEAs fail to provide these two forces effectively. As a remedy for this limitation, this article proposes a method called TPEA. TPEA maintains three populations, termed Pop1, Pop2, and Pop3. Pop1 is a regular population, updated with a constrained NSGA-II variant. Pop2 and Pop3 are two auxiliary populations, containing the innermost and outermost nondominated infeasible solutions, respectively. The analysis reveals that these two types of nondominated infeasible solutions can contribute to the generation of escape and expansion forces, respectively. Due to these two forces, TPEA is likely to identify more global optimal feasible regions, which is crucial for constrained multiobjective optimization. Also, a mating selection strategy is developed in TPEA to coordinate the interaction among these three populations. Extensive experiments on 58 benchmark CMOPs and 35 real-world ones demonstrate that TPEA is significantly superior or comparable to six state-of-the-art CMOEAs on most test instances.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3270483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10109190","Constrained multiobjective optimization;three-population;escape force;expansion force;mating selection","Statistics;Sociology;Force;Optimization;Linear programming;Evolutionary computation;Sorting","","","","","","","IEEE","26 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This discrepancy between the EMOA and the DM’s preferences may impede the search for the most-preferred solution and waste resources evaluating irrelevant objectives. Research on objective reduction has focused so far on the structure of the problem and correlations between objectives and neglected the role of the DM. We formally define here the concepts of irrelevant and hidden objectives and propose methods for detecting them, based on uni-variate feature selection and recursive feature elimination, that use the preferences already elicited when a DM interacts with a ranking-based interactive EMOA (iEMOA). We incorporate the detection methods into an iEMOA capable of dynamically switching the objectives being optimized.

Unfortunately, when it comes to multi-agent systems (MASs), complexities such as non-stationarity and partial observability bring new challenges to the field. Building a flexible and efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm capable of handling complex tasks has to date remained an open challenge. This paper presents an Multi-Agent learning system with the evolution of Social Roles (eSRMA). The main interest is placed on solving the key issues in the definition and evolution of suitable roles, and optimizing the policies accompanied by social roles in MAS efficiently. Specifically, eSRMA incorporates and cultivates role division awareness of agents to improve the ability to deal with complex cooperative tasks. Each agent is assigned a role module, which can dynamically generate roles based on the individuals’ local observations. A novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm (MARL) is designed as the principal driving force that governs the role-policy learning process by a role-attention credit assignment mechanism. Moreover, a role evolution process is developed to help agents dynamically choose appropriate roles in decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark have demonstrated that eSRMA exhibits superiority in achieving higher learning capability and efficiency for multiple agents compared to the state-of-the-art MARL methods.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3268076","The 111 Project(grant numbers:D23006); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:DUT21TD107,DUT22ZD214); The Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST(grant numbers:2022QNRC001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61906032,61836005, 62176225); Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program(grant numbers:XLYC2008017); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021ZD0112400); NSFC-Liaoning Province United Foundation(grant numbers:U1908214); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10104101","Multi-Agent Systems;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Evolutionary Roles;Decision-Making","Task analysis;Decision making;Heuristic algorithms;Behavioral sciences;Training;Sociology;Optimization","","","","1","","","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This detailed modelling approach has increased computational complexity and may also lead to violation of the additivity property of the costs. In the worst scenario, increased complexity makes the problem intractable for exact algorithms. Even when the problem is solvable, exact algorithms may not provide solutions within the given time budget, and the found solutions are not guaranteed to be optimal due to the additivity property violation. Approximate solution methods become more suitable in this case. This paper focuses on one particular real-world application, the Airport Ground Movement Problem, where both time constraints and parallel arcs are involved. We introduce a novel Memetic Algorithm for Routing in Multigraphs with Time constraints (MARMT) and present a comprehensive study of its different variants based on diverse genetic representation methods. We propose a local search operator that enhances search efficiency and effectiveness. MARMT is tested on real data based on two airports of different sizes. Our results show that MARMT does not suffer from the non-additivity property problem as it outperforms the state-of-the-art exact algorithm when allowed to converge. When a time budget of 10 seconds is imposed on MARMT, it is able to provide solutions with quality comparable (within 1-5% degradation) to the ones given by the exact algorithm with respect to the aggregated objective values. MARMT can be adapted for other applications, such as train operations.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3262743","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog?a(grant numbers:2016-01-1920); Secretar?a de Investigaci?n y Posgrado, Instituto Polit?cnico Nacional(grant numbers:20221938,20232208); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/N029356/1,EP/N029496/1,EP/N029496/2,EP/N029577/1,EP/N029577/2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10098698","Multiobjective routing and scheduling;Multigraphs;Airport ground movement;Memetic algorithm;Time windows","Time factors;Airports;Routing;Costs;Aircraft;Shortest path problem;Metaheuristics","","","","1","","","IEEE","10 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For the biomass waste collection, there is a recognized need for novel models to locate the collection facilities and plan the vehicle routes. So far most location-routing models fall into the cost-driven-only category. However, comprehensive objectives are required in the specific context, such as time-dependent pollution and speed-and load-related emission. Furthermore, location-routing problems are hierarchical by nature, containing the facility location problems (strategic level) and the vehicle routing problems (tactical level). Existing studies in this field usually adopt computational intelligence methods directly without decomposing the problem. This can be inefficient especially when multiple objectives are applied. Motivated by these, we develop a novel multi-objective optimization model for the location-routing problem for biomass waste collection. To solve this model, we explore the way to tailor evolutionary algorithms to the hierarchical structure. We develop adapted versions of two commonly used evolutionary algorithms: the genetic algorithm and the ant colony optimization algorithm. For the genetic algorithm, we divide the population by the strategic level decisions, so that each subpopulation has a fixed location plan, breaking the location-routing problem down into many multi-depot vehicle routing problems. For the ant colony optimization, we use an additional pheromone vector to track the good decisions on the location level, and segregate the pheromones related to different satellite depots to avoid misleading information. Thus, the problem degenerates into vehicle routing problem. Experimental results show that our proposed methods have better performances on the location routing problem for biomass waste collection.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3265869","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72021001); 111 Project(grant numbers:B21014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10098182","Location-routing;multi-objective optimization;genetic algorithm;ant colony optimization;multi-population technique","Biomass;Satellites;Routing;Logistics;Costs;Biological system modeling;Optimization","","","","","","","IEEE","10 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, in parallel expensive multiobjective optimization, the hypervolume-based multi-point expected improvement (EI) suffers from high computational overhead and scales poorly with the batch size. To address this issue, we integrate hypervolume-based EI with the MOEA/D framework and propose a novel EI, named the expected direction-based hypervolume improvement (DirHV-EI). The DirHV-EI only measures the hypervolume improvement within each axis-parallel box induced by the modified Tchebycheff scalarization. Thus, it has a simple analytical expression that can be easily computed. Theoretical analysis indicates that the maximization of our proposed improvement function can help to maximize both the weighted hypervolume and the Tchebycheff improvement metrics. Using DirHV-EI, we design a decomposition-based Bayesian optimization algorithm, called DirHV-EGO, for solving expensive multiobjective optimization problems. At each iteration, the MOEA/D is used to maximize the DirHV-EI values with respect to a number of direction vectors in a collaborative manner, and a number of candidate solutions can be obtained. Then, a submodularity-based greedy selection strategy is used to select multiple query points from the candidates.

Therefore, block sparse recovery requires recovering the original signal from the observed signal and the measurement matrix, where the recovered error should be small and the signal satisfies the block sparsity. In this paper, block sparse recovery is solved as a multiobjective problem (MOP) and the recovery error, sparsity, and the block number of the recovered signal are considered as the conflicting objectives. Furthermore, the dimensionality of real block sparse signals is often too large, which increases the difficulty of recovery. Cooperative coevolutionary (CC) can effectively alleviate the curse of dimensionality in block sparse recovery. In addition, block sparsity causes zero and nonzero variables in the signal to form natural clusters, which is similar to the decomposition and cooperation of subproblems in CC. Therefore, CC is used in the algorithm to solve the block sparse MOP and decomposes the original problem into different subproblems. Each subproblem has a defined nonzero degree that can be combined with the proposed adaptive operator to adaptively adjust the way of generating new solutions of subproblem, which encourages the complete solution to have block sparsity. For the increased number of function evaluations (FEs) caused by the decomposition, a new list-inquiry evaluation is designed to avoid repeated evaluation.

As video data evolves, more special perspectives and challenging video data are constantly kept up to date. This poses challenges for object tracking tasks and places higher demands on the generalization capabilities of the models. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum evolutionary learning tracker for video. The model combines quantum evolution with deep networks for tracking video objects. The model uses a quantum evolutionary learning tracker to generate a reliable population of candidate regions and a deep network for classification. In particular, the quantum evolutionary predictor predicts the object motion state through rotation operator and trajectory inference, and provides motion state information for the tracker. The predictor can incorporate object history contextual information and can provide stable candidate estimation populations for the model in case of failure of appearance features. Both quantum evolution and deep networks are combined to form an end-to-end online video object tracker. In addition, we propose a new video object tracking evaluation algorithm, Balanced Intersection over Union. The evaluation algorithm uses aspect ratios to balance the share of overlap and distance. Finally, we test the model on the OTB 2015 dataset for natural video and on the SV248A10-SOT dataset for satellite video. The performance of the proposed model is also analyzed and validated by comparing it with more than twenty classical tracker models.

Most existing multitask genetic programming methods are designed based on tree-based structures, which are not good at reusing building blocks since each sub-tree passes its outputs to only one parent. It may limit the design and performance of knowledge sharing in multitask optimization. Different from tree-based genetic programming, building blocks in linear genetic programming can be easily reused by more than one parent. Besides, existing multitask genetic programming methods always allocate each individual to a specific task and have to duplicate genetic materials from task to task in knowledge transfer, which is inefficient and often produces redundancy. Contrarily, it is natural for a linear genetic programming individual to produce multiple distinct outputs, which enables each linear genetic programming individual to solve multiple tasks simultaneously. With this in mind, we propose a new multitask linear genetic programming method that transfers knowledge via multi-output individuals (i.e., shared individuals among tasks). By integrating different solutions into one multi-output individual, the proposed method efficiently reuses common knowledge among tasks and maintains distinct behaviors for each task. The empirical results show that the proposed method has a significantly better test performance than state-of-the-art multitask genetic programming methods.

However, its prohibitive computational overhead has been a major hurdle for deployment on resource constrained platforms. Due to the training instability and the complicated network architecture, existing model acceleration techniques cannot appropriately handle the GAN compression problem. To cope with these difficulties, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to compress GAN models in the context of image translation tasks, which is termed as MEGC. Particularly, the conflict between the computational cost of the GAN model and the quality of generated image is explicitly modeled as a two-objective optimization problem, and the evolved Pareto set is utilized to guide the sampling process during supernet training, which can in turn divert the focus of the supernet training to well-performing compact subnets. Besides, an evaluation-free strategy is introduced to facilitate exploration in the search space while incurring no extra computational cost. Based on the above design, the proposed MEGC eliminates the requirement of subnet searching in the post-processing procedure. Experiments on image translation tasks under paired and unparied settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MEGC on reducing the computational cost of GANs while improving the quality of generated images compared to those of the full models.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3261135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10079129","Evolutionary Algorithm;Multi-Objective Optimization;Generative Adversarial Networks;Model Compression","Generative adversarial networks;Computational modeling;Training;Image coding;Generators;Computer architecture;Computational efficiency","","","","2","","","IEEE","23 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The critical component of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), environmental selection, is essentially a subset selection problem, i.e., selecting N solutions as the next-generation population from usually 2N candidates (where N denotes the size of the population). Another use of subset selection is the solution pre-processing procedure for decision-making, in which typically a few representatives are selected from the final population or a large-size archive, in order not to overwhelm the decision maker. Existing work for subset selection in EMO is focused on developing greedy algorithms, but may suffer from being trapped in local optima. In this paper, we approach the problem by providing a multi-objective evolutionary algorithmic framework. We consider several popular quality indicators for subset evaluation and present accelerated variants of a well-studied MOEA in the theoretical study area, Global Simple Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimizer (GSEMO), for each indicator. We conduct rigorous theoretical analyses of the acceleration procedure. Moreover, we prove that our algorithms can achieve the best-so-far approximation guarantee by the submodularity of the indicators.

Few studies have paid attention to the complementarity of different mappings in knowledge transfer. To fill this research gap, this paper proposes an ensemble method to combine multiple domain adaptation methods for knowledge transfer in EMT by considering the efficacy and diversity of these methods. First, a hierarchical clustering method is used to divide the population of each task into multiple clusters. Then, when two parental solutions are selected for knowledge transfer across tasks, the solutions within the same cluster are checked. In particular, if none of these solutions has been transferred before, the efficacy of domain adaptation methods is considered first by using roulette wheel selection based on the corresponding performance improvements in the evolutionary optimization process. Otherwise, the diversity of domain adaptation methods is emphasized by randomly selecting one of the domain adaptation methods for knowledge transfer. The effectiveness of our proposed ensemble method is validated by embedding it into existing state-of-the-art EMT algorithms, and the experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms several recently proposed EMT algorithms on most cases of two multitasking benchmark suites and one practical case.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3259067","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61836005,61871272,61876110); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076907","Domain adaptation;ensemble;knowledge transfer;evolutionary multitasking","Task analysis;Knowledge transfer;Optimization;Multitasking;Sociology;Kernel;Diversity methods","","","","1","","","IEEE","20 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

These relations, if vetted by the users, can be enforced among newly generated solutions to steer the optimization algorithm towards practically promising regions in the search space. Challenges arise for large-scale problems where the number of such variable relationships may be high.

The great change in the network will result in the community detection algorithms are difficulty obtaining valuable information from the previous snapshot, leading to negative transfer for the next time steps. This paper focuses on dynamic community detection with substantial changes by integrating higher-order knowledge from the previous snapshots to aid the subsequent snapshots. Moreover, to improve search efficiency, a higher-order knowledge transfer strategy is designed to determine first-order and higher-order knowledge by detecting the similarity of the adjacency matrix of snapshots. In this way, our proposal can keep the advantages of previous community detection results and transfer them to the next task. We conduct the experiments on four real-world networks, including the networks with great or minor changes.

However, as the number of decision variables increases, optimization algorithms face exponentially large search spaces, thereby exhibiting a degraded performance. Nonetheless, LSMOPs whose optimal solutions correspond to sparse variable vectors can be solved more efficiently by evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms. Despite the great recent strides in developing generic EMO algorithms for sparse LSMOPs, there is still room for improvement. Specifically, algorithms still struggle to find convergent and diverse Pareto fronts in an acceptable amount of time when solving sparse LSMOPs with thousands of decision variables. To better solve sparse LSMOPs, we propose a novel set of evolutionary operators to adapt small-scale EMO algorithms for sparse LSMOPs.

Job shop scheduling has a wide range of applications such as order picking in the warehouse and vaccine delivery scheduling under a pandemic.

Scheduling heuristics, e.g., dispatching rules, have been popularly used to prioritise the candidates such as machines in manufacturing to make good schedules efficiently. Genetic programming, has shown its superiority in learning scheduling heuristics for job shop scheduling automatically due to its flexible representation. This survey firstly provides comprehensive discussions of recent designs of genetic programming algorithms on different types of job shop scheduling. In addition, we notice that in the recent years, a range of machine learning techniques such as feature selection and multitask learning, have been adapted to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of scheduling heuristic design with genetic programming. However, there is no survey to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these recent approaches.

Due to the Pareto optimality of sub-problems and the complex dependency across UL solutions and LL weights, an UL solution is feasible if and only if the LL weight is Pareto optimal. It is computationally expensive to determine which LL Pareto weight in the LL Pareto weight set is the most appropriate for each UL solution. This paper proposes a bi-level multi-objective learning framework (BLMOL), coupling the above decision-making process with the optimization process of the UL-MOP by introducing LL preference r. Specifically, the UL variable and r are simultaneously searched to minimize multiple UL objectives by evolutionary multi-objective algorithms. The LL weight with respect to r is trained to minimize multiple LL objectives via gradient-based preference multi-objective algorithms. In addition, the preference surrogate model is constructed to replace the expensive evaluation process of the UL-MOP. We consider a novel case study on multi-task graph neural topology search. It aims to find a set of Pareto topologies and their Pareto weights, representing different trade-offs across tasks at UL and LL, respectively.

In this study, we model the costly task offloading problem (CTOP) in mobile edge computing networks to achieve efficient joint optimization of energy consumption and processing latency for mobile devices. Inspired by the success of evolutionary multitasking in solving complex optimization problems by leveraging the experience of simple optimization problems, we develop a novel multitasking framework whose effectiveness is demonstrated in solving the CTOP. In this framework, auxiliary tasks are created to optimize the local processing overhead and the edge processing overhead of task offloading. On this basis, we propose an effective multitask evolutionary algorithm that includes segmented knowledge transfer and auxiliary task update.

Related knowledge that is learned from cheap and simple auxiliary tasks promotes the evolutionary search for CTOP. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of knowledge transfer.

This paper presents a Mahalanobis Distance-based approach (MDA) to deal with DMOPs with stochastic changes. Specifically, we make an all-sided assessment of search environments via Mahalanobis distance on saved information to learn the relationship between the new environment and historical ones. Afterward, a change response strategy applies the learning to the new environment to accelerate the convergence and maintain the diversity of the population. Besides, the change degree is considered for all decision variables to alleviate the impact of stochastic changes on the evolving population.

However, since EMO and EMaO algorithms are stochastic, a single application may not provide a true representative set with a desired number of Pareto solutions reliably in repetitive runs and importantly with a well-distributed set of solutions.

A major reason is that many optimization problems have basins of attraction (BoAs) that differ widely in shape and size, and the population always prefers to converge toward basins of attraction that are easy to search. Although heuristic restart based on tabu search is a theoretically feasible idea to solve this problem, existing EC methods with heuristic restart are difficult to avoid repetitive search results while maintaining search efficiency. This paper tries to overcome the dilemma by online learning the BoAs and proposes a search mode called history-guided hill exploration (HGHE). In the search mode, evaluated solutions are used to help separate the search space into hill regions which correspond to the BoAs, and a classical EC method is used to locate the optimum in each hill region. An instance algorithm for continuous optimization named HGHE differential evolution (HGHE-DE) is proposed to verify the effectiveness of HGHE.

Recently, evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS) has become an emerging area, which could employ an evolutionary computation (EC) technique to automatically construct promising network architectures without human intervention. However, existing algorithms still have limitations: most standard EC approaches cannot process flexible-length architecture representations directly, and most fitness evaluation processes suffer from the exhibitive computational cost and the unreliable prediction results. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose an efficient particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based neural architecture search algorithm to search for appropriate dense blocks on image classification tasks, named EAEPSO. EAEPSO addresses the first limitation by designing an autoencoder to encode variable-length network representations as fixed-length latent vectors, which converts the original search space to a latent space that can facilitate the downstream search. Besides, an efficient and effective hierarchical fitness evaluation method is designed to guide the search process to address the second limitation. The experimental results show that EAEPSO is a very competitive ENAS algorithm that achieves an error rate of 2.74% on CIFAR-10 and 16.17% on CIFAR-100, and reduces the computational cost from hundreds or thousands of GPU-days to only 2.2 and 4 GPU-days, respectively.

Genetic programming has been widely used to automatically evolve effective scheduling heuristics for dynamic flexible job shop scheduling. A limitation of genetic programming is the premature convergence due to the loss of population diversity. To overcome this limitation, this work considers using lexicase selection to improve population diversity, which has achieved success on regression and program synthesis problems. However, it is not trivial to apply lexicase selection to genetic programming for dynamic flexible job shop scheduling, since a fitness case (training scheduling simulation) is often large-scale, making the fitness evaluation very time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a new multi-case fitness scheme, which creates multiple cases from a single scheduling simulation. Based on the multi-case fitness, we develop a new genetic programming algorithm with lexicase selection, which uses a single simulation for fitness evaluation, thus achieving a better balance between the number of cases for lexicase selection and evaluation efficiency. The experiments on a wide range of dynamic scheduling scenarios show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better population diversity and final performance than the current genetic programming parent selection methods and a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning method.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3244607","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10044237","dynamic flexible job shop scheduling;genetic programming;lexicase selection","Job shop scheduling;Dynamic scheduling;Statistics;Sociology;Training;Heuristic algorithms;Genetic programming","","","","","","","IEEE","14 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The trust game (TG) is widely used for studying trust and trustworthiness and entails a sequential interaction between two players, an investor and a trustee. It requires at least two strategies or options for an investor (e.g. to trust versus not to trust a trustee). According to the evolutionary game theory, the antisocial strategies (e.g. not to trust) evolve such that the investor and trustee end up with lower payoffs than those that they would get with the prosocial strategies (e.g. to trust). A generalisation of the TG to a multiplayer (i.e. more than two players) TG was recently proposed. However, its outcomes hinge upon two assumptions that various real situations may substantially deviate from: (i) investors are forced to trust trustees and (ii) investors can turn into trustees by imitation and vice versa. We propose an asymmetric multiplayer TG that allows investors not to trust and prohibits the imitation between players of different roles; instead, investors learn from other investors and the same for trustees. We show that the evolutionary game dynamics of the proposed TG qualitatively depends on the nonlinearity of the payoff function and the amount of incentives collected from and distributed to players through an institution. We also show that incentives given to trustees can be useful and sufficient to cost-effectively promote trust and trustworthiness among self-interested players.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3244537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10042981","Evolutionary game theory;evolutionary dynamics;replicator dynamics;trust game;incentives","Games;Statistics;Sociology;Investment;Game theory;Productivity;Supply chain management","","","","","","","CCBY","13 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In CoeCo, we leverage the divide-and-conquer strategy and put forward a co-evolutionary optimization algorithm suitable for community structure, in which two different fitness functions promote each other to find the optimal edge set. In addition, the motif hypergraph and permanence are used to improve population initialization. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method can achieve excellent efficacy in obfuscating community structure and also greatly reduces running time.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3242051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10035921","Social network;data privacy;cooperative co-evolution;community obfuscation;community detection","Privacy;Biological system modeling;Task analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Image edge detection;Social networking (online);Measurement","","","","7","","","IEEE","3 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To solve these problems, we propose a multi-population evolution based dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization algorithm. In this algorithm, we design a tribe classification operator to divide the population into different tribes according to a feasibility check and the objective values, which is beneficial for driving the population toward the feasible region and Pareto-optimal fronts. Meanwhile, a population selection strategy is proposed to identify promising solutions from tribes and exploit them to update the population. The optimal values of the distance variables vary differently with dynamic environments, thus, we design a dynamic response strategy for solutions in different tribes that estimates their distances to approach the Pareto-optimal fronts and regenerates a promising population when detecting environmental changes. In addition, a scalable generator is designed to simulate diverse movement directions and magnitudes of the optimal distance variables in real-world problems under dynamic environments, obtaining a set of improved test problems. Experimental results show the effectiveness of test problems, and the proposed algorithm is impressively competitive with several chosen state-of-the-art competitors.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3241762","Key Laboratory of Intelligent Manufacturing Technology (Shantou University), Ministry of Education(grant numbers:202109241); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61988101,61991400,61991403,62203101); Central Government Guides Local Science and Technology Development Foundation(grant numbers:2022JH6/100100055); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:N2224002-23,N2224004-01); 111 Project 2.0(grant numbers:B08015); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10035504","Dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization;tribe classification operator;population selection;dynamic response","Statistics;Sociology;Optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Constraint handling;Generators;Tracking","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Many evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to solve continuous MMOPs. However, little effort has been made to solve combinatorial (or discrete) MMOPs. Searching for equivalent Pareto optimal solutions in the discrete decision space is challenging. Moreover, the true Pareto optimal solutions of a combinatorial MMOP are usually difficult to know, which has limited the development of its optimizer. In this paper, we first propose a test problem generator for multimodal multiobjective traveling salesman problems (MMTSPs). It can readily generate MMTSPs with known Pareto optimal solutions. Then we propose a novel evolutionary algorithm to solve MMTSPs. In our proposed algorithm, we develop two new edge assembly crossover operators, which are specialized in searching for superior solutions to MMTSPs. Moreover, the proposed algorithm uses a new environmental selection operator to maintain a good balance between the objective space diversity and decision space diversity. We compare our algorithm with five state-of-the-art designs. Experimental results convincingly show that our algorithm is powerful in solving MMTSPs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3239546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024973","Evolutionary multimodal multiobjective optimization;traveling salesman problem;combinatorial optimization;test problems","Pareto optimization;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Generators;Traveling salesman problems;Search problems;Approximation algorithms","","","","2","","","IEEE","24 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The SFE algorithm performs its search process using a search agent and two operators: non-selection and selection. It comprises two phases: exploration and exploitation. In the exploration phase, the non-selection operator performs a global search in the entire problem search space for the irrelevant, redundant, trivial, and noisy features, and changes the status of the features from selected mode to non-selected mode. In the exploitation phase, the selection operator searches the problem search space for the features with a high impact on the classification results, and changes the status of the features from non-selected mode to selected mode. The proposed SFE is successful in feature selection from high-dimensional datasets. However, after reducing the dimensionality of a dataset, its performance cannot be increased significantly. In these situations, an evolutionary computational method could be used to find a more efficient subset of features in the new and reduced search space. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid algorithm, SFE-PSO (particle swarm optimization) to find an optimal feature subset. The efficiency and effectiveness of the SFE and the SFE-PSO for feature selection are compared on 40 high-dimensional datasets. Their performances were compared with six recently proposed feature selection algorithms. The results obtained indicate that the two proposed algorithms significantly outperform the other algorithms, and can be used as efficient and effective algorithms in selecting features from high-dimensional datasets.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3238420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024844","High-dimensional dataset;Feature selection;Particle swarm optimization;Evolutionary computational methods","Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Classification algorithms;Search problems;Computational efficiency;Filtering algorithms;Electronic mail","","","","2","","","IEEE","23 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Although the evolved routing policies are highly effective, they are typically very large and complex, and hard to be understood and trusted by real users. Existing studies have attempted to improve the interpretability by developing new genetic programming approaches to evolve both effective and interpretable (e.g., with smaller program size) routing policies. However, they still have limitations due to the trade-off between effectiveness and interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a new post-hoc explanation approach to explaining the effective but complex routing policies evolved by genetic programming. The new approach includes a local ranking explanation and a global explanation module. The local ranking explanation uses particle swarm optimisation to learn an interpretable linear model that accurately explains the local behaviour of the routing policy for each decision situation. Then, the global explanation module uses a clustering technique to summarise the local explanations into a global explanation. The experimental results and case studies on the benchmark datasets show that the proposed method can obtain accurate and understandable explanations of the routing policies evolved for uncertain arc routing problems. Our explanation approach is not restricted to uncertain arc routing, but has a great potential to be generalised to other optimisation and machine learning problems such as learning classifier systems and reinforcement learning.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3238741","New Zealand Royal Society Marsden Fund(grant numbers:VUW1614); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024365","Capacitated Arc Routing;Genetic Programming;Hyper-Heuristic;Interpretability","Task analysis;Routing;Costs;Computational modeling;Vehicle dynamics;Training;Random variables","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

With the sustainable development of e-waste recycling, low-carbon order scheduling becomes a significant and challenging reverse logistics scheduling problem. However, it is difficult to obtain an effective low-carbon order schedule considering the conflicting interests of the multiple stakeholders, including enterprises, drivers, customers, and governments. To address this issue, a multi-objective order scheduling model (MOOSM) and a multi-objective differential evolution algorithm balancing multiple stakeholders (MODE-MS) are proposed in this paper. First, to embody the interests of different stakeholders, three time-dependent key variables are calculated by the road congestion and vehicle load, including the velocity, travelling time and carbon emission. Second, with the above key variables, a five-objective order scheduling model is formulated to describe the low-carbon order scheduling problem in e-waste recycling. Third, for solving the MOOSM, a multi-objective differential evolution algorithm based on an adaptive evolutionary search strategy is developed to obtain the low-carbon and stakeholders satisfied scheduling schemes. The experimental results validate the feasibility of MOOSM and the effectiveness of MODE-MS. By comparing with four state-to-art algorithms, the advantages of the proposed MODE-MS are further demonstrated in solving the low-carbon order scheduling.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3237336","Beijing Outstanding Young Scientist Program(grant numbers:BJJWZYJH01201910005020); National Key Research and Development Project(grant numbers:2018YFC1900800-5,2022YFB3305800-5); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:KZ202110005009); Youth Beijing Scholar(grant numbers:037); R&D Program of Beijing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:KM202210005027); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61890930-5,61903010,62021003,62125301); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10018475","Multi-objective differential evolution algorithm;multiple stakeholders;low-carbon order scheduling;e-waste recycling;reverse logistics","Scheduling;Recycling;Stakeholders;Electronic waste;Optimization;Vehicle routing;Fuels","","","","","","","IEEE","17 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Due to the nested structure, the upper level population evaluation requires a set of complete lower level optimizations, thereby reducing the efficiency and practicability of EA methods. In this paper, a multi-objective transformation-based evolutionary algorithm (MOTEA) is proposed to perform multiple lower level optimizations in a parallel and collaborative manner. Specifically, the corresponding multiple lower level optimizations for each generation of the upper level population evaluation are transformed into locating a set of Pareto optimal solutions of a constructed multi-objective optimization problem. By utilizing the built-in implicit parallelism of evolutionary multi-objective optimization, multiple lower level problems can thus be optimized in parallel. Within one multi-objective search population, the collaboration among the parallel lower level optimization can be realized by exploiting and utilizing the implicit similarities among them for better efficiency. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed MOTEA are verified by comparing it with four state-of-the-art evolutionary bi-level optimization algorithms on two sets of popular bi-level optimization benchmark test problems and three application problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3236455","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62006044 and Grant 62172110); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10016238","Bi-level optimization;multi-objective transformation;evolutionary algorithm;implicit parallelism;population decomposition","Optimization;Search problems;Statistics;Sociology;Pareto optimization;Task analysis;Shape","","","","","","","IEEE","12 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
