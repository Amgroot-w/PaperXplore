The challenge in solving DMOPs is how to track the varying Pareto optimal solution sets quickly and accurately. Therefore, an inter-individual correlation and dimension-based dual learning method is proposed in this paper. Two learning strategies, decomposition-based inter-individual correlation transfer learning (DICTL) and dimension-wise learning (DL), are developed to respectively generate one-half of the initial population in the new environment. More specifically, DICTL learns the inter-individual correlation from the final population of the adjacent environment and then transfers it to the new environment, aiming to maintain the diversity and distribution of the predicted population. While DL extracts the changing pattern of dynamic environments from the high-quality solutions of historical environments in the perspective of variable dimension, trying to improve the quality of the population and accelerate the convergence. The designed two learning strategies (DICTL&DL) work complementarily and collaboratively to make the algorithm adapt to dynamic environments better and faster. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted by comparing the proposed method with four state-of-the-art algorithms on 14 benchmark problems. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2023.3235196","Research Award Fund for Outstanding Young Teachers in Henan Provincial Institutions of Higher Education(grant numbers:2020GGJS141,2021GGJS111); Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province(grant numbers:202300410511,212300410321); "Central Plains Thousand Talents Plan"-Top Talents in Central Plains(grant numbers:ZYQR201810162); Science and Technology Innovation Team of Colleges and Universities in Henan Province(grant numbers:22IRTSTHN015); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876169,61922072,61976237,62103456); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10012059","Dynamic multiobjective optimization;dual learning;inter-individual correlation;dimension","Sociology;Correlation;Optimization;Convergence;Heuristic algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Manifolds","","","","IEEE","9 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Learning-based methods are popular to extract the changing pattern of optimal solutions for predicting new solutions. They tend to use all variables as features (i.e., inputs) to build prediction models. However, there are usually some irrelevant and redundant variables, which increase training difficulty and decrease prediction accuracy. This paper proposes a new interaction-based prediction method, which captures the correlation of variables with prediction targets and selects the most relevant variables to build prediction models using neural networks. In particular, the interaction between variables is detected to remove redundant variables. In addition, a correction procedure is developed to further improve predicted solutions according to the prediction error in past environments. The predicted solutions are used to update the population according to a specifically designed update strategy. Integrating the interaction-based prediction (IP) method into the framework of multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), a new algorithm named IP-DMOEA is put forward. Experimental results on a typical dynamic multiobjective test suite demonstrate the better performance of the proposed IPDMOEA than state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of convergence speed and solution quality.

The disassembly line balancing problem (DLBP) considers how to allocate disassembly operations to operators on the disassembly line to optimize predetermined goals, such as cycle time. In practice, various environmental uncertainties (e.g., uncertain product quality) exist in the disassembly line. These uncertainties entail DLBP essentially a dynamic multi-objective optimization problem. This study presents a dynamic DLBP (D-DLB) to model the effect of environmental uncertainties on the assignment of disassembly operations. Furthermore, a prediction-based dynamic optimization algorithm, termed domain generalization-based dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (DG-DMOEA), combining meta-learning with multi-objective optimization, is proposed to solve D-DLB. In DG-DMOEA, a meta-learning algorithm is employed to learn the parameters of a solution-generative model from the Pareto-optimal sets in all historical environments. Subsequently, the solution-generative model is applied to generate a high-quality initial population that can assist multi-objective optimization algorithms in finding the Pareto-optimal set in the new environment faster. Since no information in the new environment is required, learning can begin before the new environment arrives, significantly reducing computational time. Moreover, different solution-generative models can be designed for different DMOPs. Therefore, DG-DMOEA can thoroughly combine real-world problem properties to represent knowledge. The experimental results show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, DG-DMOEA can considerably improve the quality of solutions and significantly enhance the ability to react quickly to environmental changes.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3233642","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52075402); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10005005","Dynamic multi-objective optimization;dynamic optimization algorithm;meta-learning;domain generalization;disassembly line balancing","Optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Uncertainty;Predictive models;Statistics;Sociology","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Meanwhile, the development of neural architecture search (NAS) has provided promising approaches to automating the design of network architectures for lower prediction error. Recently, the emerging application scenarios of deep learning (e.g., autonomous driving) have raised higher demands for network architectures considering multiple design criteria: number of parameters/weights, number of floating-point operations, inference latency, among others. From an optimization point of view, the NAS tasks involving multiple design criteria are intrinsically multiobjective optimization problems; hence, it is reasonable to adopt evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms for tackling them. Nonetheless, there is still a clear gap confining the related research along this pathway: on the one hand, there is a lack of a general problem formulation of NAS tasks from an optimization point of view; on the other hand, there are challenges in conducting benchmark assessments of EMO algorithms on NAS tasks. To bridge the gap: (i) we formulate NAS tasks into general multi-objective optimization problems and analyze the complex characteristics from an optimization point of view; (ii) we present an end-to-end pipeline, dubbed EvoXBench, to generate benchmark test problems for EMO algorithms to run efficiently -without the requirement of GPUs or Pytorch/Tensorflow; (iii) we instantiate two test suites comprehensively covering two datasets, seven search spaces, and three hardware devices, involving up to eight objectives.

In this paper, we develop a bilevel metaheuristic with the collaborations among lower-level optimization tasks. Specifically, a population is evolved to solve the lower-level optimization tasks for all upper-level solutions collaboratively at each generation. In the population, each solution is associated with a lower-level optimization task. In such a way, all lower-level optimization tasks can be solved in a single run. To capture the individual features of different lower-level optimization tasks, we construct a lower-level search distribution for each lower-level optimization task based on all solutions in the population. In addition, an information-sharing mechanism is proposed to share good solutions among lower-level optimization tasks.

Similarly, computer scientists have made great efforts to design artificial neural network (ANN) and evolutionary computation (EC) to simulate the learning ability and the optimization ability for solving real-world problems, respectively. These have been two essential branches in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science. However, in humans, learning and optimization are usually integrated together for problem solving. Therefore, how to efficiently integrate these two abilities together to develop powerful AI remains a significant but challenging issue. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel learning-aided evolutionary optimization (LEO) framework that plus learning and evolution for solving optimization problems. The LEO is integrated with the evolution knowledge learned by ANN from the evolution process of EC to promote optimization efficiency. The LEO framework is applied to both classical EC algorithms and some state-of-the-art EC algorithms including a champion algorithm, with benchmarking against the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation competition data. The experimental results show that the LEO can significantly enhance the existing EC algorithms to better solve both single-objective and multi-/many-objective global optimization problems, suggesting that learning plus evolution is more intelligent for problem solving. Moreover, the experimental results have also validated the time efficiency of the LEO, where the additional time cost for using LEO is greatly deserved. Therefore, the promising LEO can lead to a new and more efficient paradigm for EC algorithms to solve global optimization problems by plus learning and evolution.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3232776","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2102102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10002945","Evolutionary computation;learning-aided evolution;artificial neural network;particle swarm optimization;differential evolution;single-objective optimization;multi-objective optimization;many-objective optimization","Optimization;Artificial intelligence;Evolution (biology);Artificial neural networks;Learning systems;Problem-solving;Benchmark testing","","","","9","","","CCBY","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The key challenge in such a DD-MOP is to prevent the serious deterioration on the accuracy of the obtained approximate Pareto front. In this paper, two novel strategies, critical fitness for evolutionary algorithms and data augmentation for a surrogate model, are complementarily imposed by a generative adversarial network (GAN) to tackle with the challenges in DD-MOPs. In the critical fitness strategy, a new critical fitness, composed of the critical score from the discriminator of GAN and the prediction value of surrogate model, is proposed to improve the accuracy of approximate Pareto front of a DD-MOP. In the data augmentation strategy, some new samples are synthetized by the generator of GAN to build a better-trained surrogate model. As a result, the GAN concurrently serves the critical fitness strategy and the data augmentation strategy as the roles of “killing two birds with one stone”.

A deep ensemble model includes several deep neural networks as base-learners. Building a deep ensemble model is a challenging task, since maintaining the prediction performance of each base-learner and the diversity among base-learners at the same time is difficult. To address this problem, this paper proposes a two-stage optimization algorithm for deep ensemble model generation, called ELDE-TS. ELDE-TS aims to build a weighted voting-based deep ensemble model for classification tasks end-to-end. The ensemble model includes several convolutional neural network classifiers with different hyperparameters. Each classifier is assigned a weight. The first stage of ELDE-TS is a bi-objective algorithm that generates candidate classifiers for the ensemble model. It takes the validation accuracy and the diversity among classifiers as the optimization objectives. A novel objective function is proposed for the first stage to describe the diversity among the classifiers. The second stage is a single-objective algorithm, which selects representative classifiers for the ensemble model and calculates a weight for each classifier. A tree-based non-repetitive evaluation mechanism is embedded in the second stage to accelerate the search process. The experimental results show that the ensemble model generated by ELDE-TS has competitive performance over the state-of-the-art ensemble models and hand-designed deep models on the Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets.

The performance of CC depends on how variables are being grouped and can be improved through guided variable decomposition for various optimization problems.

This paper proposes an effective yet efficient differential grouping (EDG) method to reduce the associated computational cost. Our method exploits the historical interrelationship information of previous variable groups to examine interactions between the remnant variable groups. This allows us to spend less computing resources without compromising the accuracy of the final grouping result. Our proposal utilizes the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm, in conjunction with EDG, to solve LSGOPs. Further, to reduce time complexity and improve the stability of CMA-ES, we substitute the complex matrix decomposition step with simpler matrix operations to compute the square root of the covariance matrix. Results from our experiments and analysis indicate that EDG is a competitive method to solve LSGOPs and improve the performance of CC. The proposed schemes significantly enhance the searchability of CMA-ES compared to the other large-scale variants of CMA-ES and state-of-the-art large-scale optimizers.

The most significant novel techniques, implemented for the first time to solve the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP), are as follows: (a) node clustering where transition vertices are organized into a set of candidate lists called clusters; (b) adaptive pheromone evaporation which is adapted during optimization according to the diversity of the population of ant solutions (measured by information entropy).

It iteratively draws solutions from its model and, considering their fitnesses, uses these solutions to update the model’s parameters. However, there is a risk of reinforcing random noise from sampling back into the model – a problem termed genetic drift. We propose the Competing Genes Evolutionary Algorithm that optimizes a fitness function over a binary search space and avoids this problem by updating only one model parameter at a time. The algorithm uses the model not only to sample solutions but also to select a parameter in each iteration that it pins to a value for the rest of the search process. We obtain upper bounds on the number of fitness evaluations the algorithm needs to solve well-known benchmark functions as a function of its population size and observe better or comparable results to other evolutionary algorithms.

However, current approaches often present two potential problems. Firstly, although tasks may have different characteristics, existing literature usually utilizes only one search operator for all of them. Secondly, while multitasking environments comprise tasks of varying difficulty, previous proposals treat them equally. This paper proposes an algorithm named Ensemble Multifactorial Evolution with Biased Skill Factor Inheritance (EME-BI) for optimizing a large number of tasks simultaneously. In EME-BI, an effective parameter adaptation based on the knowledge transfer quality with Biased Skill-Factor Inheritance mechanism is designed to minimize negative transfer and allocate generated offspring to tasks that need resources. Besides, instead of using only one fixed search operator, EME-BI can automatically select the most appropriate one for each task at each evolutionary stage. Finally, the proposed algorithm is armed with a dynamically adjusted population size to promote exploitation. Empirical studies on various many-task benchmark problems and a real-world problem are conducted to verify the efficiency of EME-BI. The results portrayed that EME-BI achieves highly competitive performance compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms regarding the solution quality, convergence trend, and computation time.

To address this issue, this paper proposes an expensive many-objective optimization algorithm based on the framework of NSGA-III and assisted by the kriging surrogate models. In the proposed algorithm, the Monte Carlo sampling method for EHVI estimation is improved by importance sampling, in which only one sampling process is required during the entire optimization process using a uniform distribution in normalized objective space. Considering the predicted uncertainty from the kriging model, an uncertainty-assisted nondominated sorting approach is proposed to substitute for the conventional approach in NSGA-III. In the proposed method, the predicted uncertainty is incorporated into the objective space as one independent dimension for nondominated sorting, which can enable the exploration of potential points with desirable EHVI values. In addition, the proposed algorithm considers the diversity of the solutions by de-emphasizing the pursuit of the best EHVI. The experimental results on benchmark problems demonstrate that the proposed EHVI calculation method can save computational costs compared with Monte Carlo sampling and indicate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the others.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3228516","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52075068); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1702502); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9979775","Expected hypervolume improvement;expensive many-objective optimization;importance sampling;kriging","Uncertainty;Predictive models;Optimization;Sorting;Prediction algorithms;Statistics;Sociology","","","","6","","","IEEE","9 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To address this issue, this paper proposes a new evolutionary multi-objective based method, which aims to explain the behaviours of deep convolutional neural networks by evolving local explanations on specific images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evolutionary multi-objective method to evolve local explanations. The proposed method is model-agnostic, i.e. it is applicable to explain any deep convolutional neural networks. ImageNet is used to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method. Three well-known deep convolutional neural networks -VGGNet, ResNet, and MobileNet, are chosen to demonstrate the modelagnostic characteristic. Based on the experimental results, it can be observed that the local explanations are understandable to end-users, who need to check the sensibility of the evolved explanations to decide whether to trust the predictions made by the deep convolutional neural networks. Furthermore, the local explanations evolved by the proposed method improves the confidence of deep convolutional neural networks making the predictions.

Evolutionary algorithms are widely used as sampling algorithms in docking programs. However, both the linkage problem and the dimensionality degenerate the search ability of evolutionary algorithms in the docking process. Therefore, a newly designed docking program named AutoDock Koto was developed in this study, which adopts a novel gradient boosting differential evolution algorithm to effectively address these issues. Experimental results show that compared with commonly used docking programs, AutoDock Koto yields dramatic improvements in docking performance based on an extensive dataset of 285 protein-ligand complexes. In addition, due to its strong docking ability, AutoDock Koto was used to identify potential drugs for COVID-19 based on a virtual screening of all approved drugs in our experiments.

To address this issue, a knowledge guided transfer strategy based DMOEA is proposed in the paper. First, knowledge described as a two-tuple is extracted under each historical environment and preserved to a knowledge pool. Redundant knowledge is recognized and adaptively removed so as to guarantee the diversity of the pool. Second, a knowledge matching strategy is developed to re-evaluate the representative of each stored knowledge under a new environment, with the purpose of finding the most valuable one to promote positive knowledge transfer. Third, an improved knowledge transfer mechanism based on subspace alignment is introduced. By integrating it with knowledge reuse mechanism, a hybrid transfer strategy is constructed to adaptively select the most suitable one in terms of the similarity degree of selected knowledge on the current environment, and then generate a new initial population.

However, when selecting from a large candidate set (e.g., from hundreds of thousands of candidate solutions), most HSS methods fail to strike a balance between the computation time and the subset quality. In this paper, we propose a new local search HSS method and its extended version. Three strategies are proposed: The first two strategies are applied to the proposed method to obtain a good subset within a small computation time, and the third one is applied to the extended version to further improve the obtained subset.

Multi-objective feature selection in classification has its unique characteristics, such as it has a strong preference for the classification performance over the number of selected features. Besides, solution duplication often appears in both the search and the objective spaces, which degenerates the diversity and results in the premature convergence of the population. To deal with the above issues, in this paper, during the evolutionary training process, a multi-objective feature selection problem is reformulated and solved as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem, which adds a constraint on the classification performance for each solution (e.g., feature subset) according to the distribution of nondominated solutions, with the aim of selecting promising feature subsets that contain more informative and strongly relevant features, which are beneficial to improve the classification performance. Furthermore, based on the distribution of feature subsets in the objective space and their similarity in the search space, a duplication analysis and handling method is proposed to enhance the diversity of the population.

However, GP-based methods usually require a long computation time for fitness evaluations, posing a challenge to real-world applications. Surrogate models can be efficiently computable approximations of expensive fitness evaluations. However, most existing surrogate methods are designed for evolutionary computation techniques with a vector-based representation consisting of numerical values, thus cannot be directly used for GP with a tree-based representation consisting of functions/operators. The variable sizes of GP trees further increase the difficulty of building the surrogate model for fitness approximations. To address these limitations, we propose a new surrogate-assisted GP approach including global and local surrogate models, which can accelerate the evolutionary learning process and achieve competitive classification performance simultaneously. The global surrogate model can assist GP in exploring the entire search space, while the local surrogate model can speed up convergence and further improve performance. Furthermore, a new surrogate training set is constructed to assist in establishing the relationship between the GP tree and its fitness, and effective surrogate models can be built accordingly. Experimental results on ten datasets of varying difficulty show that the new approach significantly reduces the computational cost of the GP-based method without sacrificing the classification accuracy. The comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods also demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach.

Neural network-based deep learning methods are effective for image classification, but they typically require large-scale training data and have major limitations such as requiring expertise to design network architectures and having poor interpretability. Evolutionary deep learning is a recent hot topic that combines evolutionary computation with deep learning. However, most evolutionary deep learning methods focus on evolving architectures of neural networks, which still suffers from limitations such as poor interpretability. To address this, this paper proposes a new genetic programming-based evolutionary deep learning approach to data-efficient image classification. The new approach can automatically evolve variable-length models using many important operators from both image and classification domains. It can learn different types of image features from colour or gray-scale images, and construct effective and diverse ensembles for image classification. A flexible multi-layer representation enables the new approach to automatically construct shallow or deep models/trees for different tasks and perform effective transformations on the input data via multiple internal nodes. The new approach is applied to solve five image classification tasks with different training set sizes. The results show that it achieves better performance in most cases than deep learning methods for data-efficient image classification. A deep analysis shows that the new approach has good convergence and evolves models with high interpretability, different lengths/sizes/shapes, and good transferability.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3214503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9919314","Evolutionary Deep Learning;Genetic Programming;Image Classification;Small Data;Evolutionary Computation;Deep Learning","Image classification;Deep learning;Artificial neural networks;Task analysis;Training;Computer architecture;Computational modeling","","","","3","","","IEEE","14 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, a multi-scenario optimization evolutionary algorithm based on transfer framework is proposed. In one iteration, for each sce-nario, its knee solutions are recognized as its transfer candidates and are used to construct a constraint hyperplane, which deter-mines whether transfer candidates from other scenarios can be the transferable solutions in this underlying scenario. Then, among all transfer candidates, those accepted by all scenarios are identified as the public compromised optimal solutions and stored in archive. Afterwards, archive updating process is applied to guarantee the optimality of solutions in archive and control the size of archive. Finally, each scenario’s accepted transferable solutions are uti-lized in its offspring generation, thus achieving information trans-fer between different scenarios.

Furthermore, most of the existing CHTs are derived by solving constrained single-objective optimization. The information hidden from the feasible non-dominated set (FNDS) has not been fully utilized. This study proposed a novel parameter-less constraint handling technique, which divides the entire population into three mutually exclusive subsets dynamically: FNDS, the subset dominated by FNDS, and the subset not dominated by FNDS. According to the proposed division of labor, it is not necessary to balance the convergence and constrained satisfaction in each subset. To avoid being entrapped in local optima, the proposed algorithm adopts a two-stage strategy to solve CMOPs. In the first stage, the proposed algorithm focuses solely on converging toward the unconstrained Pareto front without considering the constrained satisfaction. In the second stage, the FNDS constraint handling technique is adopted to guide the population converging toward constrained Pareto front effectively. The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to that of nine state-of-the-art CMOEAs, and the comparison results show that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better on the CF, MW, and LIRCMOP test suites.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3202723","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9869698","Constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm;constrained multi-objective optimization problem;evolution strategy","Convergence;Statistics;Sociology;Optimization;Constraint handling;Tuning;Pareto optimization","","","","3","","","IEEE","29 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, it is also challenging due to its large search space. Recently, competitive swarm optimiser (CSO) has shown promising results in FS because of its potential global search ability. The main idea of CSO is to select two solutions randomly and then let the loser (worse fitness) learn from the winner (better fitness). Although such a search mechanism provides a high population diversity, it is at risk of generating unqualified solutions since the winner’s quality is not guaranteed. In this work, we propose a constrained evolutionary mechanism for CSO, which verifies the quality of all the particles and lets the infeasible (unqualified) solutions learn from the feasible (qualified) ones. We also propose a novel local search and a size-change operator that guide the population to search for smaller feature subsets with similar or better classification performance. A surrogate model, based on support vector machines, is proposed to assist both local search and the size-change operator to explore a massive number of potential feature subsets without requiring excessive computational resource.

Conventional MOEAs usually require a large number of function evaluations (FEs) for evaluating the quality of solutions. However, only a limited number of FEs are affordable in many real-world optimization problems where the FEs are computationally or economically expensive. The use of a large number of FEs decreases the effectiveness of MOEAs in solving these problems. This article proposes a dual fuzzy classifier-based surrogate model (DFC) and a DFC-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm framework (DFC-MOEA) for expensive optimization problems. The DFC model is used for offspring pre-selection to choose high-quality offspring solutions and for categorization to divide unevaluated solutions into three categories. In the proposed framework, two fuzzy classifiers are built to predict the quality of each unevaluated solution. To strike a balance between convergence and diversity, one classifier is designed for predicting the dominance relation of unevaluated solutions (i.e., convergence), and another classifier is designed for predicting the crowdedness of unevaluated solutions (i.e., diversity). The integration of the proposed framework in three different types of MOEAs (i.e., a dominance-based MOEA, an indicator-based MOEA, and a decomposition-based MOEA) demonstrates its usefulness in handling expensive optimization problems. Comprehensive experiments on four well-known test suites and several real-world optimization problems demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to improve the performance of MOEAs under a limited number of FEs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3195668","The Stable Support Plan Program of Shenzhen Natural Science Fund(grant numbers:20200925174447003); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876075,62106099); The Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9847362","Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;fuzzy classifiers;surrogate-based evolutionary algorithms;expensive multiobjective optimization","Optimization;Iron;Linear programming;Convergence;Evolutionary computation;Computational modeling;Training","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To study attack strategies in denied environments, this work proposes a novel Evolutionary Algorithm-based Attack Strategy with Swarm Robots for the first time. Each robot obtains its situation information through perceiving its nearby peers and enemies. Such information is utilized to evaluate the benefits or threats of a robot’s next perceptible attack positions. Then, each robot uses the evolutionary algorithm to optimize its fitness function and searches for its optimal position. A collision avoidance strategy is integrated into the algorithm. Hence, a robot swarm realizes collaboration and handles confrontation as long as each robot can sense its surroundings. They utilize their own sensors to detect others locally without using global positioning and communication devices. The experimental analyses show that the evolutionary algorithm-based attack strategy has better scalability and more potential in solving large-scale confrontational problems than the deep reinforcement learning-based algorithms.
