Ranging from small refinements to the incorporation of sophisticated novel ideas, the majority of modifications proposed to this algorithm have been the result of a manual process in which developers try new designs based on their own knowledge and expertise. However, manually introducing changes is very time consuming and makes the systematic exploration of all the possible algorithm configurations a difficult process. In this article, we propose to use automatic design to overcome the limitations of having to manually find performing PSO algorithms. We develop a flexible software framework for PSO, called PSO-X, which is specifically designed to integrate the use of automatic configuration tools into the process of generating PSO algorithms. Our framework embodies a large number of algorithm components developed over more than 25 years of research that have allowed PSO to deal with a large variety of problems, and uses irace, a state-of-the-art configuration tool, to automatize the task of selecting and configuring PSO algorithms starting from these components. We show that irace is capable of finding high-performing instances of PSO algorithms never proposed before.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3102863","Belgian F.R.S.–FNRS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9507530","Automatic algorithm design;continuous optimization;particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Topology;Tools;Particle swarm optimization;Software algorithms;Optimization;Manuals;Software","mathematics computing;particle swarm optimisation","component-based framework;particle swarm optimization algorithm;PSO algorithms;automatic configuration tools;PSO-X;flexible software framework","","14","","48","CCBY","5 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although computational resources increased substantially over the last decade, a complete solution to PSP problems by computational methods has not yet been obtained. Using only one energy function is insufficient to characterize proteins because of their complexity. Diverse protein energy functions and evolutionary computation algorithms have been extensively studied to assist in the prediction of protein structures in different ways. Such algorithms are able to provide a better protein with less computational resources requirement than deep learning methods. For the first time, this study proposes a many-objective PSP (MaOPSP) problem with four types of objectives to alleviate the impact of imprecise energy functions for predicting protein structures. A many-objective evolutionary algorithm (MaOEA) is utilized to solve MaOPSP. The proposed method is compared with existing methods by examining 34 proteins. An analysis of the objectives demonstrates that our generated conformations are more reasonable than those generated by single/multiobjective optimization methods. Experimental results indicate that solving a PSP problem as an MaOPSP problem with four objectives yields better PSPs, in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

For its robustness with respect to noise, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been expected to have great potential for dynamic optimization. Many dynamic optimization methods, such as diversity-driven methods, memory methods, and prediction methods have been proposed based on EAs to deal with environmental changes. However, they face difficulties in adapting to fast changes in dynamic optimization as EAs normally need quite a few fitness evaluations to find a near-optimum solution. To address this issue, this article proposes a new framework of applying EAs in the context of dynamic optimization to deal with fast changing environments. We suggest that instead of online evolving (searching) solutions for the ever-changing objective function, EAs are more suitable for acquiring an archive of solutions in an offline way, which could be adopted to construct a system to provide high-quality solutions efficiently in a dynamic environment. To be specific, we formulate the offline search as a static set-oriented optimization problem. Then, a set of solutions is obtained by an EA for this set-oriented optimization problem. After this, the obtained solution set is adopted to do fast adaptation to the corresponding dynamic optimization problem. The general framework is instantiated for continuous dynamic-constrained optimization problems, and the empirical results show the potential of the proposed framework. The superiority of the framework is also verified on a dynamic vehicle routing problem with changing demands.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3104343","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61906082); Honda Research Institute Europe (HRI-EU); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); Shenzhen Peacock Plan(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); Research Institute of Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (RITAS); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:19511120602); National Leading Youth Talent Support Program of China; MOE University Scientific-Technological Innovation Plan Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9512284","Dynamic constrained optimization;dynamic optimization;local search;negatively correlated search;set-oriented optimization","Optimization;Vehicle dynamics;Statistics;Sociology;Heuristic algorithms;Search problems;System analysis and design","dynamic programming;evolutionary computation;search problems","objective functions;dynamic vehicle routing;static set-oriented optimization;evolutionary algorithms;offline evolutionary search;fitness evaluations;continuous dynamic-constrained optimization","","4","","43","IEEE","12 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been widely used for FS due to being efficient and easy to implement. However, when dealing with high-dimensional data, most of the existing PSO-based FS approaches face the problems of falling into local optima and high-computational cost. Evolutionary multitasking is an effective paradigm to enhance global search capability and accelerate convergence by knowledge transfer among related tasks. Inspired by evolutionary multitasking, this article proposes a multitasking PSO approach for high-dimensional FS. The approach converts a high-dimensional FS task into several related low-dimensional FS tasks, then finds an optimal feature subset by knowledge transfer between these low-dimensional FS tasks. Specifically, a novel task generation strategy based on the importance of features is developed, which can generate highly related tasks from a dataset adaptively. In addition, a new knowledge transfer mechanism is presented, which can effectively implement positive knowledge transfer among related tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can evolve a feature subset with higher classification accuracy in a shorter time than other state-of-the-art FS methods on high-dimensional classification.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3100056","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1302400); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61773242,61803227,61922072,61876169); Major Agricultural Applied Technological Innovation Projects of Shandong Province(grant numbers:SD2019NJ014); Shandong Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:ZR2019MF064); Intelligent Robot and System Innovation Center Foundation(grant numbers:2019IRS19); Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1913,VUW1914); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge (SfTI) Fund(grant numbers:E3603/2903); University Research Fund at Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:223805/3986); MBIE Data Science SSIF Fund(grant numbers:RTVU1914); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9496593","Evolutionary multitasking;feature selection (FS);high-dimensional classification;knowledge transfer;particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Task analysis;Feature extraction;Multitasking;Optimization;Search problems;Knowledge transfer;Particle swarm optimization","evolutionary computation;feature selection;particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;search problems","evolutionary multitasking;feature selection;high-dimensional classification;particle swarm optimization;preprocessing technique;feature sets;high-dimensional data;high-computational cost;multitasking PSO approach;high-dimensional FS task;low-dimensional FS tasks;optimal feature subset;highly related tasks;knowledge transfer mechanism;positive knowledge transfer;state-of-the-art FS methods;PSO-based FS approaches;task generation strategy","","32","","62","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, an encoding scheme and a reasonable decoding method are designed, considering the tradeoff between two conflicting objectives. Second, two problem-specific heuristics are presented for hybrid initialization to generate diverse solutions. Third, solutions are refined with appropriate improvement operator selected by the RL-based policy agent. Meanwhile, an effective solution selection method based on the decomposition strategy is utilized to balance the convergence and diversity. Fourth, an intensification search with multiple problem-specific operators is incorporated to further enhance the exploitation capability. Moreover, two energy-saving strategies are designed for improving the nondominated solutions. The effect of parameter setting is investigated and extensive numerical tests are carried out.

The DoM indicator can differentiate the sets for certain important features, such as convergence, spread, uniformity, and cardinality. DoM does not require any reference point or any representative Pareto solution set, and it has an intuitive and physical meaning, similar to the  $\epsilon $ -indicator. It calculates the minimum total move of members of one set so that all elements in another set are to be dominated or identical to at least one member of the first set. Despite the aforementioned desired properties, DoM is hard to calculate, particularly for higher dimensions. There is an efficient and exact method to calculate it in biobjective problems. This work proposes a novel approach to calculate DoM using a mixed-integer programming (MIP) approach, which can handle two sets with two or more objectives and is shown to overcome the issue of information loss associated with the  $\epsilon $ -indicator. Experiments in the biobjective space are done to verify the model’s correctness. Furthermore, other experiments, using 3-, 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, 25-, and 30-objective problems, are performed to show how the model behaves in higher dimensional cases. Algorithms, such as IBEA, MOEA/D, NSGA-III, NSGA-II, and SPEA2, are used to generate the solution sets; however, any other algorithm can also be used with the proposed MIP-DoM indicator. Further extensions are discussed to handle certain idiosyncrasies with some solution sets and improve the quality indicator and its use for other scenarios.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3096669","Brazilian funding agencies: CAPES, FAPEMIG and CNPq; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9481257","Evolutionary algorithms;quality indicators;mixed-integer programming (MIP);multicriteria optimization;multiobjective optimization;performance assessment","Optimization;Convergence;Programming;Motion measurement;Computational efficiency;Visualization;Task analysis","integer programming;Pareto optimisation;set theory","dominance move;binary quality indicator;multiobjective optimization;many-objective optimization;representative Pareto solution set;intuitive meaning;ϵ-indicator;mixed-integer programming;30-objective problems;MIP-DoM indicator","","1","","39","IEEE","12 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article takes the analysis further by considering the RIDGE, an asymmetric landscape almost uncovered in the literature. For the elitist algorithm, estimates of expected progress along the radial and longitudinal axes are derived, then tested numerically against the real behavior of the algorithm on several functions from this class. The global behavior of the algorithm is predicted correctly by iterating the one-step analytical formulas. Moreover, experiments show identical mean value dynamics for the algorithms with uniform and normal mutation, which implies that the derived formulas apply also to the normal case.

The multiobjective supply chain configuration (MOSCC) in SCM is to set the optimal configurations for supply chain members to minimize both the cost of goods sold ( $CoGS$ ) and the lead time ( $LT$ ). Although some algorithms have been proposed for the MOSCC, they do not make the best use of the problem-related knowledge and cannot perform well on the large-scale instances with many members and configuration options. Therefore, this article proposes a multipopulation ant colony system with knowledge-based local searches (MPACS-KLSs). First, the multiobjective algorithm is based on the multiple populations for multiple objectives framework. Two ant colonies are used to separately minimize  $CoGS$  and  $LT$ , which helps to search in the biobjective space sufficiently. Second, with the considerations of the problem-related knowledge, a priority-based solution construction method, a rank-based heuristic strategy, and an objective-oriented global pheromone updating strategy are proposed. Third, to speed up the convergence, especially for large-scale MOSCC instances, two knowledge-based local searches are designed to minimize  $CoGS$  and  $LT$  of solutions, respectively. Exhaustive experiments are conducted on both the instances from the real life and the randomly generated instances with different problem scales.

To address this issue, we devise a dynamic transfer reference point-oriented MOEA/D with local objective-space knowledge (DTR-MOEA/D). The design principle is based on three original and rigorous mechanisms. First, the individuals are projected onto a line segment (two-objective case) or a 3-D plane (three-objective case) after being normalized in the objective space. The line segment or the plane is divided into three different regions: 1) the central region; 2) the middle region; and 3) the edge region. Second, a dynamic transfer criterion of the reference point is developed based on the population density relationships in different regions. Third, a strategy of population diversity enhancement guided by local objective-space knowledge is adopted to improve the diversity of the population. Finally, the experimental results conducted on 16 benchmark MOPs and eight modified MOPs with irregular POF shapes verify that the proposed DTR-MOEA/D has attained a strong competitiveness compared with other representative algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3140265","Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:JQ19013); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61773373,61890930-5,62021003); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021ZD0112302,2021ZD0112301,2018YFC1900800-5); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9669184","Decomposition;dynamic transfer reference point;local objective space;multiobjective optimization","Statistics;Sociology;Optimization;Convergence;Pareto optimization;Optical fibers;Shape","evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation","decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm;multiple conflicting objectives;Pareto-optimal front;multiobjective optimization problems;line segment;two-objective case;three-objective case;dynamic transfer criterion;dynamic transfer reference point-oriented MOEA/D;local objective-space knowledge;irregular POF shapes;DTR-MOEA/D;representative algorithms","","13","","64","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A learning system often has poor generalization performance due to the lack of sufficient training data. Genetic programming (GP) has been successfully applied to image classification and achieved promising performance. This article proposes a GP-based approach with a dual-tree representation and a new fitness function to automatically learn image features for FSIC. The dual-tree representation allows the proposed approach to have better searchability and learn richer features than a single-tree representation when the number of training instances is very small. The fitness function based on the classification accuracy and the distances of the training instances to the class centroids aims to improve the generalization performance. The proposed approach can deal with different types of FSIC tasks with various numbers of classes and different image sizes. The results show that the proposed approach achieves significantly better performance than a large number of state-of-the-art methods on nine 3-shot and 5-shot image classification datasets. Further analysis shows the effectiveness of the new components of the proposed approach, its good searchability, and the high interpretability of the evolved solutions.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3100576","Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1913,VUW1914); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge (SfTI) Fund(grant numbers:E3603/2903); University Research Fund at Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:223805/3986); MBIE Data Science SSIF Fund(grant numbers:RTVU1914); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61876169); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9499117","Few-shot learning (FSL);fitness evaluation;genetic programming (GP);image classification;representation","Training;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Genetic programming;Transfer learning;Genetic algorithms;Knowledge transfer","genetic algorithms;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;trees (mathematics)","GP-based approach;dual-tree representation;fitness function;image features;single-tree representation;classification accuracy;FSIC tasks;different image sizes;3-shot;5-shot image classification datasets;dual-tree genetic programming;few-shot image classification;important but challenging task;learning system;poor generalization performance","","5","","59","IEEE","28 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To cope with this NP-hard problem with high complexity, a variety of evolutionary computation (EC) techniques has been developed. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of these techniques, in this article, we proposed a novel memetic estimation of the distribution algorithm-based approach, namely, MEEDA, to tackle this problem. In particular, MEEDA explores four different domain-dependent local search methods that search for effective composite services by utilizing several neighborhood structures. Apart from that, to significantly reduce the computational time of MEEDA, an efficient local search strategy is introduced by combining a uniform fitness distribution scheme for selecting suitable solutions and stochastic local search operators for effectively and efficiently exploiting neighbors. To better demonstrate MEEDA’s effectiveness and scalability, we create a more challenging, augmented version of the service composition benchmark dataset. Experimental results on this benchmark show that MEEDA with newly developed domain-dependent local search operator, i.e., layer-based constrained one-point swaps, significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms in finding high-quality composite services.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3127633","New Zealand Marsden Fund, administrated; Royal Society of New Zealand(grant numbers:VUW1510); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9612583","Combinatorial optimization;estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA);quality of service (QoS) optimization;Web service composition","Quality of service;Web services;Memetics;Benchmark testing;Semantic Web;Computational modeling;Genetic algorithms","computational complexity;evolutionary computation;optimisation;quality of service;search problems;semantic Web;service-oriented architecture;Web services","evolutionary computation techniques;distribution algorithm;MEEDA;composite services;local search strategy;memetic EDA-based approaches;QoS-aware fully automated semantic Web service composition;quality-of-service-aware automated semantic Web service composition;NP-hard problem;polynomial time;memetic estimation;service-oriented architecture","","3","","57","IEEE","12 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most of the existing EMT algorithms only consider handling two tasks simultaneously. As the computational cost incurred in the evolutionary search and knowledge transfer increased rapidly with the number of optimization tasks, these EMT algorithms cannot meet today’s requirements of optimization service on the cloud for many real-world applications, where hundreds or thousands of optimization requests (labeled as large-scale EMT) are often received simultaneously and require to be optimized in a short time. Recently, graphics processing unit (GPU) computing has attracted extensive attention to accelerate the applications possessing large-scale data volume that are traditionally handled by the central processing unit (CPU). Taking this cue, toward large-scale EMT, in this article, we propose a new EMT paradigm based on the island model with the compute unified device architecture (CUDA), which is able to handle a large number of continuous optimization tasks efficiently and effectively. Moreover, under the proposed paradigm, we develop the GPU-based implicit and explicit knowledge transfer mechanisms for EMT. To evaluate the performance of the proposed paradigm, comprehensive empirical studies have been conducted against its CPU-based counterpart in large-scale EMT.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3110506","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61876025,61876162); Venture and Innovation Support Program for Chongqing Overseas Returnees(grant numbers:cx2018044,cx2019020); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR(grant numbers:PolyU11202418,PolyU11209219); Australian Research Council (ARC)(grant numbers:LP180100114,DP200102611); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530458","Compute unified device architecture (CUDA);evolutionary multitasking (EMT);graphics processing unit (GPU) computing;knowledge transfer;optimization","Graphics processing units;Optimization;Task analysis;Instruction sets;Knowledge transfer;Parallel processing;Search problems","coprocessors;evolutionary computation;graphics processing units;optimisation;parallel architectures","large-scale evolutionary multitasking;GPU-based paradigm;optimization quality;convergence speed;complex optimization problems;EMT algorithms;computational cost;evolutionary search;optimization service;optimization requests;large-scale EMT;graphics processing unit computing;large-scale data volume;central processing unit;compute unified device architecture;continuous optimization tasks;explicit knowledge transfer;CPU-based counterpart","","1","","50","IEEE","6 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
