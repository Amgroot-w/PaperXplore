Consequently, there is no consensus regarding the best practice for rigorous benchmarking, and whether this is possible at all outside the context of a given application. Here, we argue that synthetic datasets must continue to play an important role in the evaluation of clustering algorithms, but that this necessitates constructing benchmarks that appropriately cover the diverse set of properties that impact clustering algorithm performance. Through our framework, HAWKS, we demonstrate the important role evolutionary algorithms play to support flexible generation of such benchmarks, allowing simple modification and extension. We illustrate two possible uses of our framework: 1) the evolution of benchmark data consistent with a set of hand-derived properties and 2) the generation of datasets that tease out performance differences between a given pair of algorithms.

To define generally applicable benchmarks, we introduce the notion of mission generator: a tool to generate missions that mimic those a design method will eventually have to solve. To minimize the variance of the performance estimation, we show that, under some common assumptions, one should adopt the sampling strategy that maximizes the number of missions considered—a formal proof is provided as the supplementary material.

However, the relationship between existing suites is not clear, and the field would benefit from a “stock-take” assessment. This article investigates the coverage of current continuous multiobjective suites using the instance space analysis (ISA) methodology. Exploratory landscape analysis is used to measure critical features of each problem suite. Thereafter, we generate a 2-D visualization of the existing problem instances by locating them in the instance space, assessing their diversity, and identifying whether there are sparse areas of value to fill with new problem instances. Our findings show that the current suites are restricted in diversity when representing the entire problem instance space. We propose and evaluate three problem construction methods: 1) problem tuning; 2) toolkit hybridization; and 3) new function injection. Problem tuning is shown to generate problems surrounding existing instances, while hybridization creates problems falling between existing suites. Furthermore, utilizing the insights afforded by ISA, we show how problem features can be identified to inform the creation of new functions which fill gaps toward the boundaries of the instance space.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3205165","Australian Research Council through the Australian Laureate Fellowship(grant numbers:FL140100012); ARC Training Centre in Optimisation Technologies, Integrated Methodologies and Applications (OPTIMA)(grant numbers:IC200100009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9881541","Benchmark suites;experimental evaluation;instance space analysis (ISA);multiobjective optimization (MO);problem generation","Benchmark testing;Prediction algorithms;Optimization;Measurement;Tuning;Search problems;Visualization","benchmark testing;evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation;search problems","2D visualization;algorithm design;continuous multiobjective optimization domain;continuous multiobjective suites;DTLZ;exploratory landscape analysis;instance space analysis methodology;multiobjective optimization benchmark construction;problem construction methods;problem tuning;stock-take assessment;toolkit hybridization;WFG;ZDT","","1","","62","IEEE","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we delve deep into the Bayesian statistical assessment of experimental results by proposing a framework for the analysis of several algorithms on several problems/instances.

From the set of rankings, we estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters of the studied probability models, and several inferences concerning the analysis of the results are examined. Particularly, we study questions related to the probability of having one algorithm in the first position of the ranking or the probability that two algorithms are in the same relative position in the ranking.

Hence, our assessment is solely based on runtime measurements. We discuss proper choices for solution quality indicators in single- and multi-objective optimization, as well as in the presence of noise and constraints.

Feature-based algorithm selection has recently received attention in the research field of black-box numerical optimization. However, there is still room for the analysis of algorithm selection for black-box optimization. Most previous studies have focused only on whether an algorithm selection system can outperform the single-best solver (SBS) in a portfolio. In addition, a benchmarking methodology for algorithm selection systems has not been well investigated in the literature. In this context, this article analyzes algorithm selection systems on the 24 noiseless black-box optimization benchmarking functions. First, we demonstrate that the first successful performance measure is more reliable than the expected runtime measure for benchmarking algorithm selection systems. Then, we examine the influence of randomness on the performance of algorithm selection systems. We also show that the performance of algorithm selection systems can be significantly improved by using sequential least squares programming as a presolver. We point out that the difficulty of outperforming the SBS depends on algorithm portfolios, cross-validation methods, and dimensions. Finally, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of algorithm portfolios depends on various factors.

Even though this approach is guided by expert knowledge, it is still somewhat arbitrary. The process rarely allows for gaining a holistic understanding of which algorithmic components drive performance and carries the risk of overlooking good algorithmic design choices. We present a principled approach to automated benchmark-driven algorithm design applied to multifidelity HPO (MF-HPO). First, we formalize a rich space of MF-HPO candidates that includes, but is not limited to, common existing HPO algorithms and then present a configurable framework covering this space. To find the best candidate automatically and systematically, we follow a programming-by-optimization approach and search over the space of algorithm candidates via Bayesian optimization. We challenge whether the found design choices are necessary or could be replaced by more naive and simpler ones by performing an ablation analysis.

These advancements are often facilitated by benchmarks and competitions that enable performance comparisons and rankings of solvers. Simultaneously, meta-algorithmic techniques, such as automated algorithm selection and configuration, enable performance improvements by utilizing the complementary strengths of different algorithms or configurable algorithm components. In fact, meta-algorithms have become major drivers in advancing the state of the art in solving many prominent computational problems. However, meta-algorithmic techniques are complex and difficult to use correctly, while their incorrect use may reduce their efficiency, or in extreme cases, even lead to performance losses.

The framework establishes a relationship between estimated costs of parallel function evaluations (on real-world problems) to known sets of test functions. Such real-world problems are not always readily available (e.g., confidentiality and proprietary software). Therefore, new test problems are created by Gaussian process simulation. The proposed framework is applied in an extensive benchmark study to compare multiple state-of-the-art parallel optimizers with a novel model-based algorithm, which combines ideas of an explorative search for global model quality with parallel local searches to increase function exploitation. The benchmarking framework is used to configure good batch size setups for parallel algorithms systematically based on landscape properties. Furthermore, we introduce a proof of concept for a novel automatic batch size configuration. The predictive quality of the batch size configuration is evaluated on a large set of test functions and the functions generated by Gaussian process simulation. The introduced algorithm outperforms multiple state-of-the-art optimizers, especially on multimodal problems. Additionally, it proves to be particularly robust over various problem landscapes, and performs well with all tested batch sizes.

In this article, we propose a novel behavior-based benchmark toolbox: BIAS (Bias in algorithms, structural). This toolbox can detect structural bias (SB) per dimension and across dimension-based on 39 statistical tests. Moreover, it predicts the type of SB using a random forest model. BIAS can be used to better understand and improve existing algorithms (removing bias) as well as to test novel algorithms for SB in an early phase of development. Experiments with a large set of generated SB scenarios show that BIAS was successful in identifying bias. In addition, we also provide the results of BIAS on 432 existing state-of-the-art optimization algorithms showing that different kinds of SB are present in these algorithms, mostly toward the center of the objective space or showing discretization behavior.

For the upper level subproblem, an ACO algorithm is used to generate customer service sequence. Both the direct encoding scheme and the order-first split-second encoding scheme are implemented to make a guideline of their applicable scenes. For the lower level subproblem, a new heuristic called simple enumeration is proposed to generate recharging schedules for vehicles. Between the two subproblems, a confidence-based selection method is proposed to select promising customer service sequence to conduct local search and lower level optimization. By setting adaptive confidence thresholds, the inferior service sequences that have little chance to become the iteration best are eliminated during the execution.

This article presents a simple and effective knee point identification (KPI) method to help DMs identify solution(s) of interest from a given set of tradeoff solutions thus facilitating posterior decision making. Our basic idea is to sequentially validate whether a solution is a knee point or not by comparing its localized tradeoff utility with others within its neighborhood characterized from a decomposition perspective. In particular, a solution is a knee point if and only if it has the best-localized tradeoff utility among its neighbors. We implement a GPU version that carries out the KPI in a parallel manner. This GPU version reduces the worst-case complexity from quadratic to linear. The performance of our proposed method is compared with five state-of-the-art KPI methods on 134 test problem instances and two real-world engineering design problems. Empirical results demonstrate its outstanding performance especially on problems with many local knee points.

Even though many algorithms have been developed, they mainly focus on objective-homogeneous problems, where the source and target tasks possess a similar number of objectives. In this work, we explore objective-heterogeneous problems, in which knowledge transfers across single-objective optimization problems (SOPs), multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), and many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). Objective-heterogeneous problems challenge the existing methods due to the diverse search and objective spaces between the source and the target task. To address this issue, we present a decision variable analysis-based transfer method that can conduct knowledge transfer across problems with the different numbers of objectives. We first separate decision variables of MOPs and MaOPs into convergence-related variables (CVs) and diversity-related variables (DVs), according to their roles while treating variables of SOPs as CVs. Then, we propose a convergence transfer module to transfer knowledge of CVs to speed up the convergence. It aligns both solutions and fitness ranks for preserving fitness rank consistency between the source and target tasks, whereby accelerating search speed. Besides, a diversity transfer module is presented to refine the distribution of DVs to maintain the population diversity.

However, such a strategy usually demands a large number of function evaluations to obtain an accurate variable grouping. To address this issue, a merged differential grouping (MDG) method is proposed in this article based on the subset–subset interaction and binary search. In the proposed method, each variable is first identified as either a separable variable or a nonseparable variable. Afterward, all separable variables are put into the same subset, and the nonseparable variables are divided into multiple subsets using a binary-tree-based iterative merging method. With the proposed algorithm, the computational complexity of interaction detection is reduced to  $O(\max \{n,n_{ns}\times \log _{2} k\})$ , where  $n$ ,  $n_{ns}(\leq n)$ , and  $k( < n)$  indicate the numbers of decision variables, nonseparable variables, and subsets of nonseparable variables, respectively.

The few existing studies are limited by the dynamic scenarios considered, and by overly complicated algorithms that are unable to benefit from the wealth of contributions provided by the existing CARP literature. In this article, we first provide a mathematical formulation of dynamic CARP (DCARP) and design a simulation system that is able to consider dynamic events while a routing solution is already partially executed. We then propose a novel framework which can benefit from the existing static CARP optimization algorithms so that they could be used to handle DCARP instances. The framework is very flexible. In response to a dynamic event, it can use either a simple restart strategy or a sequence transfer strategy that benefits from the past optimization experience.

However, existing IMRT planning methods can only generate one solution at a time and, consequently, medical physicists should perform the planning process many times to obtain diverse solutions to meet the requirement of a clinical case. Meanwhile, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have not been fully exploited in IMRT planning since they are ineffective in optimizing the large number of discrete variables of IMRT. To bridge the gap, this article formulates IMRT planning into a large-scale combinatorial many-objective optimization problem and proposes a coevolutionary algorithm to solve it. In contrast to the existing MOEAs handling high-dimensional search spaces via variable grouping or dimensionality reduction, the proposed algorithm evolves one population with fine encoding for local exploitation and evolves another population with rough encoding for global exploration. Moreover, the convergence speed is further accelerated by two customized local search strategies. The experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art MOEAs and IMRT planning methods on a variety of clinical cases.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3144675","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0100100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61822301,61876123,61906001,62106002,62136008); Collaborative Innovation Program of Universities in Anhui Province(grant numbers:GXXT- 2020-013,GXXT-2020-051); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:PolyU11202418,PolyU11209219); Alexander von Humboldt Professorship for Artificial Intelligence funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686948","Combinatorial optimization;evolutionary computation;intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT);large-scale optimization;many-objective optimization","Planning;Optimization;Apertures;Linear programming;Tumors;Sequential analysis;Particle beams","cancer;convergence;dosimetry;evolutionary computation;genetic algorithms;optimisation;Pareto optimisation;radiation therapy;search problems","cancer treatment;clinical case;coevolutionary algorithm;discrete variables;diverse solutions;existing IMRT planning methods;existing MOEAs;high-dimensional search spaces;intensity-modulated radiotherapy planning;many-objective evolutionary algorithm;many-objective optimization problem;medical physicists;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;planning process many times;variable grouping","","1","","64","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We compare in this work the results of four different hyperparameter optimization (HPO) approaches for a family of genetic algorithms (GAs) on 25 diverse pseudo-Boolean optimization (PBO) problems. More precisely, we compare previously obtained results from a grid search with those obtained from three automated configuration techniques: 1) iterated racing; 2) mixed-integer parallel-efficient global optimization (MIP-EGO); and 3) mixed-integer evolutionary strategies. Using two different cost metrics: 1) expected running time (ERT) and 2) the area under the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) curve, we find that in several cases the best configurations with respect to ERT are obtained when using the area under the ECDF curve as the cost metric during the configuration process. Our results suggest that even when interested in ERT performance, it might be preferable to use anytime performance measures for the configuration task. We also observe that tuning for ERT is much more sensitive with respect to the budget that is allocated to the target algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3159087","Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)(grant numbers:201706310143); Paris Ile-de-France Region; ANR(grant numbers:11-LABX-0056-LMH (LabEx LMH)); COST Action(grant numbers:CA15140); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9733420","Algorithm configuration (AC);black-box optimization;evolutionary computation;performance measures","Genetic algorithms;Optimization;Measurement;Tuning;Costs;Distribution functions;Statistics","computational complexity;evolutionary computation;genetic algorithms;integer programming","automated configuration techniques;configuration process;configuration task;ECDF curve;empirical cumulative distribution function curve;ERT performance;evolutionary computation;genetic algorithm automated configuration;grid search;HPO approach;hyperparameter optimization approach;MIP-EGO;mixed-integer evolutionary strategies;mixed-integer parallel-efficient global optimization;optimization problem;PBO problem;pseudoBoolean optimization;target algorithms","","2","","55","IEEE","14 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In robotics, such algorithms can be used for generating a collection of controllers covering most of the possible behaviors of a robot. To do so, these algorithms associate a behavioral descriptor (BD) to each of these behaviors. Each BD is used for estimating the novelty of one behavior compared to the others. In most existing algorithms, the BD needs to be hand-coded, thus requiring prior knowledge about the task to solve. In this article, we introduce: autonomous robots realizing their abilities, an algorithm that uses a dimensionality reduction technique to automatically learn BDs based on raw sensory data. The performance of this algorithm is assessed on three robotic tasks in simulation. The experimental results show that it performs similar to traditional hand-coded approaches without the requirement to provide any hand-coded BD. In the collection of diverse and high-performing solutions, it also manages to find behaviors that are novel with respect to more features than its hand-coded baselines. Finally, we introduce a variant of the algorithm which is robust to the dimensionality of the BD space.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3159855","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through Project REcoVER(grant numbers:EP/V006673/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9736995","Behavioral diversity;optimization methods;quality-diversity (QD) optimization;robotics;unsupervised learning","Containers;Robots;Magnetosphere;Ion radiation effects;Robot sensing systems;Task analysis;Optimization","control engineering computing;data reduction;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;optimisation","autonomous robots;BD;behavioral descriptor;dimensionality reduction;evolutionary algorithms;QD;quality-diversity optimization;robotic tasks;sensory data;unsupervised behavior discovery","","2","","51","IEEE","16 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, a cooperative coevolution (CC) with knowledge-based variable decomposition, called bilevel multiobjective CC (BLMOCC), is proposed for BLMOPs. In BLMOCC, the variable interactions are represented by an interaction matrix. The perturbation-based variable decomposition combined with the matrix completion approach has been designed for dynamically discovering the correlation among the bilevel variables, based on which the variables are divided into different groups. To further handle possible weak correlations among various groups of variables, a CC has been adopted for optimizing them in a collaborative way. In experimental studies, BLMOCC is compared with a nested method (NS) and a state-of-the-art algorithm (H-BLEMO) on a set of benchmark problems. The effects of each component in BLMOCC have also been verified by comparing it with its three variants. The experimental results demonstrate that BLMOCC has the best performance among all the compared algorithms. In addition, BLMOCC has also been applied to a real-world management decision-making problem, which further validates its efficiency and effectiveness.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3154057","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62072234,62125302,62102178,61732006); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0700300); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China(grant numbers:BK20181288,BK20200443); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9721406","Bilevel multiobjective optimization;cooperative coevolution (CC);dynamic variable decomposition;matrix completion","Optimization;Knowledge based systems;Correlation;Computer science;Matrix decomposition;Mathematical programming;Task analysis","decision making;evolutionary computation;matrix algebra","benchmark problem set;bilevel multiobjective CC;bilevel multiobjective optimization problems;bilevel variables;BLMOCC;BLMOP;H-BLEMO;interaction matrix;knowledge-based dynamic variable decomposition;knowledge-based variable decomposition;matrix completion approach;nested bilevel structure;nested method;NS;perturbation-based variable decomposition;practical multiobjective optimization problems;real-world management decision-making problem;variable interactions","","4","","62","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most of existing evolutionary algorithms focus on searching a globally optimal band subset under a fixed size, and their obtained band subsets may still contain a large number of redundant bands. In order to simultaneously obtain multiple optimal band subsets with different sizes, this article proposes an unsupervised multitask artificial bee colony (ABC) BS algorithm based on variable-size clustering (MBBS-VC). First, a variable-size band clustering method based on worst class decomposition is developed, based on which the BS problem can be modeled as a multitask optimization problem. Next, a multitask multimicrogroup bee colony algorithm with variable coding length is proposed to simultaneously search multiple optimal band subsets with different sizes. Moreover, several new strategies, including the intergroup collaboration strategy based on bidirectional neighborhood learning and the multimeasure integration judgment (MIJ) mechanism, are designed to improve the performance of MBBS-VC. In this article, the hyperspectral BS problem is transformed into a multitask optimization problem for the first time. Finally, compared with 15 classical BS algorithms on several commonly used datasets, experimental results verify the superiority of the proposed BS algorithm.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3159253","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876185,61876184,62133015); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities, JLU(grant numbers:93K172021K16); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9733922","Artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization;evolutionary optimization;feature selection;hyperspectral image","Optimization;Multitasking;Clustering algorithms;Hyperspectral imaging;Task analysis;Statistics;Sociology","artificial bee colony algorithm;evolutionary computation;feature selection;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;pattern clustering;search problems;unsupervised learning","bidirectional neighborhood learning;dimensionality reduction technique;evolutionary algorithm;hyperspectral BS problem;hyperspectral image;intergroup collaboration strategy;MBBS-VC;multimeasure integration judgment mechanism;multitask bee colony band selection algorithm;multitask multimicrogroup bee colony algorithm;multitask optimization problem;optimal band subsets;redundant bands;unsupervised multitask artificial bee colony BS algorithm;variable coding length;variable-size band clustering method;worst class decomposition","","10","","66","IEEE","14 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This manuscript presents a multiple classifiers-assisted evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, which is adapted for high-dimensional expensive problems in terms of the following two insights. Compared to approximation-based surrogates, the accuracy of classification-based surrogates is robust for few high-dimensional training samples. Furthermore, multiple local classifiers can hedge the risk of overfitting issues. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm builds multiple classifiers with support vector machines (SVMs) on a decomposition-based multiobjective algorithm, wherein each local classifier is trained for a corresponding scalarization function. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm is competitive to the state-of-the-art algorithms and computationally efficient as well.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3159000","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:20H04254); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9733428","Classification-based surrogate;high-dimensional multiobjective optimization;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (SAEA)","Linear programming;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Support vector machines;Adaptation models;Iron;Principal component analysis","approximation theory;evolutionary computation;pattern classification;support vector machines","approximation-based surrogates;classification-based surrogates;computationally expensive optimization;decomposition-based multiobjective algorithm;high-dimensional expensive problems;high-dimensional multiobjective problems;high-dimensional training samples;low-dimensional problems;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;multiple classifiers-assisted evolutionary algorithm;multiple local classifiers;support vector machines;surrogate-assisted multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;SVM","","8","","75","IEEE","14 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Suitable values for these constants must be drawn from appropriate, but typically unknown, distributions for the problem being modeled. While rarely used with GP,  $Z$ -score standardization of feature and response spaces often significantly improves the predictive performance of GP by removing scale issues and reducing error due to bias. However, in some cases it is also associated with erratic error due to variance. This article demonstrates that this variance component increases in the presence of gaps at the boundaries of the training data explanatory variable intervals. An initial solution to this problem is proposed that augments training data with pseudo instances located at the boundaries of the intervals. When applied to benchmark problems, particularly with small training samples, this solution reduces error due to variance and, therefore, total error. Augmentation is shown to also stabilize error in larger problems; however, results suggest that standardized GP works well on such problems with little need for training data augmentation.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3160414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9737222","Bias-variance decomposition;data augmentation;evolutionary machine learning;feature scaling;genetic programming (GP);prediction error;standardization;symbolic regression","Training;Training data;Data models;Predictive models;Mathematical models;Standards;Sensitivity","genetic algorithms;regression analysis","benchmark problems;data augmentation;ephemeral random constants;erratic error;genetic programming;predictive performance;response spaces;standardized GP;symbolic regression;total error;training data explanatory variable intervals;variance component","","1","","35","IEEE","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This has led to the emergence of a specialized research area called evolutionary large-scale multiobjective optimization (ELMO). In general, it is believed that multiobjective optimization problems become more difficult as the number of decision variables increases. However, the following two counterintuitive observations are obtained from careful examinations of recent ELMO studies. One is that experimental results on some large-scale multiobjective test problems were improved by increasing the number of decision variables. The other is that better results were obtained for some other large-scale multiobjective test problems by conventional EMO algorithms (EMOAs) than state-of-the-art ELMO algorithms (ELMOAs). These observations suggest that ELMOAs have not always been evaluated on appropriate test problems. Moreover, their performance is not always better than the performance of conventional EMOAs. In this letter, we first re-examine the performance of ELMOAs and conventional EMOAs on a wide variety of scalable multiobjective test problems. Then, counterintuitive experimental results are analyzed using the anytime performance evaluation scheme and distributions of randomly generated initial solutions. Based on the analysis, suggestions on how to handle large-scale multiobjective test problems with counterintuitive results are proposed.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3161363","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876075,62002152); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); The Stable Support Plan Program of Shenzhen Natural Science(grant numbers:20200925174447003); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9739745","Anytime performance evaluation;evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO);large-scale multiobjective optimization;test problems","Optimization;Performance evaluation;Sociology;Pareto optimization;Couplings;Benchmark testing;Shape","evolutionary computation","appropriate test problems;conventional EMO algorithms;conventional EMOA performance;counterintuitive experimental results;ELMO algorithms;ELMOA;evolutionary large-scale multiobjective test problems;evolutionary multiobjective optimization community;large-scale multiobjective optimization;multiobjective optimization problems;scalable multiobjective test problems","","","","42","IEEE","22 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
