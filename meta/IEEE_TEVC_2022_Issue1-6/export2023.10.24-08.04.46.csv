The field of large-scale global optimization is concerned with improving the scalability of global optimization algorithms, particularly, population-based metaheuristics. Such metaheuristics have been successfully applied to continuous, discrete, or combinatorial problems ranging from several thousand dimensions to billions of decision variables. In this two-part survey, we review recent studies in the field of large-scale black-box global optimization to help researchers and practitioners gain a bird’s-eye view of the field, learn about its major trends, and the state-of-the-art algorithms. Part I of the series covers two major algorithmic approaches to large-scale global optimization: 1) problem decomposition and 2) memetic algorithms. Part II of the series covers a range of other algorithmic approaches to large-scale global optimization, describes a wide range of problem areas, and finally, touches upon the pitfalls and challenges of current research and identifies several potential areas for future research.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3130838","ARC (Australian Research Council) Discovery(grant numbers:DP180101170,DP190101271); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); Program for University Key Laboratory of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017KSYS008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627116","Black-box optimization;evolutionary optimization;large-scale global optimization;metaheuristics","Optimization;Couplings;Search problems;Genetic algorithms;Scalability;Memetics;Buildings","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);metaheuristics;search problems","problem decomposition;memetic algorithms;decision variables;high-dimensional machine learning;large-scale engineering problems;large-scale black-box global optimization;population-based metaheuristics","","16","","228","CCBY","25 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue, this article proposes an enhanced competitive swarm optimization algorithm assisted by a strongly convex sparse operator (SCSparse). A tricompetition mechanism is introduced into competitive swarm optimization, aiming to strike a better balance between exploration and exploitation. In addition, the SCSparse is embedded in the position updating of the particles to generate sparse solutions.

Such expensive problems can be addressed by Gaussian process-assisted evolutionary algorithms. In many problems, the (single) objective and constraints are correlated to some extent. Unfortunately, existing works based on the Gaussian process for expensive constrained optimization treat the objective and multiple constraints as being statistically independent, typically for the ease of computation. To fill this gap, this article investigates the correlation among the objective and constraints. To be specific, we model the correlation amongst the objective and constraint functions using a multitask Gaussian process prior, and then mathematically derive a constrained expected improvement acquisition function that allows the correlation among the objective and constraints. The correlation between the objective and constraints can be captured and leveraged during the optimization process. The performance of the proposed method is examined on a set of benchmark problems and a real-world antenna design problem. On problems with high correlation amongst the objective and constraints, the experimental results show that leveraging the correlation yields improvements in both the optimization speed and the constraint-handling ability compared with the method that assumes the objective and constraints are statistically independent.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3120980","Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:MFP-VUW1913,MFP-VUW1914); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge (SfTI)(grant numbers:2019-S7-CRS); MBIE Data Science SSIF Fund(grant numbers:RTVU1914); MBIE Research Program(grant numbers:C11X2001 (PFR No. 39186)); NZSQ Data Science Catalyst Program(grant numbers:2021-37-004A); University Research Fund at Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:223805/3986); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61876169); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9580458","Constrained optimization;expected improvement (EI);expensive optimization;multitask Gaussian process","Optimization;Correlation;Gaussian processes;Bayes methods;Antennas;Uncertainty;Data models","constraint handling;evolutionary computation;Gaussian processes","complex physical experiments;Gaussian process-assisted highly constrained expensive optimization;objective constraints;constraint-handling ability;real-world antenna design problem;benchmark problems;multitask Gaussian process;constraint functions;objective functions;expensive constrained optimization;Gaussian process-assisted evolutionary algorithms","","8","","67","IEEE","19 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In such optimization problems, namely, multimodal MOPs (MMOPs), multiple decision vectors can be projected to the same solution in the objective space (i.e., there are multiple implementations corresponding to that solution). Therefore, the diversity in the decision space is very important for the decision maker when tackling MMOPs. Subset selection methods have been widely used in the field of evolutionary multiobjective optimization for selecting well-distributed solutions (in the objective space) to be presented to the decision maker. However, since most subset selection methods do not consider the diversity of solutions in the decision space, they are not suitable for MMOPs. In this article, we aim to clearly demonstrate the usefulness of subset selection for multimodal multiobjective optimization. We propose a novel subset selection framework that can be easily integrated into existing multimodal multiobjective optimization algorithms. By selecting a prespecified number of solutions with good diversity in both the objective and decision spaces from all the examined solutions, the proposed framework significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art multimodal multiobjective optimization algorithms on various test problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3117702","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876075); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); The Stable Support Plan Program of Shenzhen Natural Science Fund(grant numbers:20200925174447003); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9559411","Decision space diversity;multimodal multiobjective optimization;objective space diversity;subset selection","Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Search problems;Standards;Spatial diversity;Maintenance engineering;Linear programming","decision making;evolutionary computation;operations research;optimisation;set theory;vectors","decision spaces;multimodal multiobjective optimization algorithms;diversity-enhanced subset selection framework;real-world multiobjective optimization problems;multiple decision vectors;objective space;decision maker;MMOPs;subset selection methods;evolutionary multiobjective optimization;multimodal MOPs","","10","","51","IEEE","5 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared with the performance of a baseline genetic algorithm (GA) on solving the maximum value of the binary function, MGA can converge better and faster. In addition, MGA is more efficient because of its parallelism on matrix operations, and MGA runs 2.5 times faster than the baseline GA when using the NumPy library. Considering the advantages of the memristor in matrix operations, memristor circuits are designed for the deployment of MGA. This deployment method realizes the parallelization and in-memory computing (memristor is both memory and computing unit) of MGA. In order to verify the effectiveness of this deployment, a feature selection experiment of logistic regression (LR) on Sonar datasets is completed.

As changes in DMOP may exist some patterns that are predictable, to solve DMOP, a number of research efforts have been made to develop evolutionary search with prediction approaches to estimate the changes of the problem. A common practice of existing prediction approaches is to predict the change of Pareto-optimal solutions (POS) based on the historical solutions obtained in the decision space. However, the change of a DMOP may occur in both decision and objective spaces. Prediction only in the decision space thus may not be able to give the proper estimation of the problem change. Taking this cue, in this article, we propose an evolutionary search with multiview prediction for solving DMOP. In contrast to existing prediction methods, the proposed approach conducts prediction from the views of both decision and objective spaces. To estimate dynamic changes in DMOP, a kernelized autoencoding model is derived to perform the multiview prediction in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which holds a closed-form solution. To examine the performance of the proposed method, comprehensive empirical studies on the commonly used DMOP benchmarks, as well as a real-world case study on the movie recommendation problem, are presented. The obtained experimental results verified the efficacy of the proposed method for solving both benchmark and real-world DMOPs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3135020","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61876025,61876162,61673328); Venture & Innovation Support Program for Chongqing Overseas Returnees(grant numbers:cx2018044,cx2019020); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR(grant numbers:PolyU11202418,PolyU11209219); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9650552","Dynamic multiobjective optimization;evolutionary search;prediction-based method","Optimization;Optical fibers;Statistics;Sociology;Predictive models;Heuristic algorithms;Prediction algorithms","decision theory;evolutionary computation;Hilbert spaces;Pareto optimisation","problem change;evolutionary search;multiview prediction;DMOP;objective spaces;dynamic changes;reproducing kernel Hilbert space;movie recommendation problem;dynamic multiobjective optimization problem;Pareto-optimal solutions;decision space;kernelized autoencoding model;RKHS;closed-form solution","","8","","53","IEEE","14 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose an EDA probability model based on the asymmetric generalized Gaussian mixture model, which describes the area in the solution space as comprehensively as possible and constructs a probability model of complex distribution points, especially for missing and outliers. We propose a transformation and a Gaussian evolution strategy in the selection mechanism of EDA to process the deformation, rotation, and denoising of selected dominant individuals. Considering the complexity of the model, we choose to optimize from the perspective of variational Bayesian, and introduce a prior probability distribution through local variation to reinforce the convergence of the algorithm in dealing with complex point sets. In addition, a local search mechanism based on the simulated annealing algorithm is added to realize the coarse-to-fine registration.

Such an attack can easily succeed by the existing white-box attack methods, where the perturbation is calculated based on the gradient of the target network. Unfortunately, the gradient is often unavailable in the real-world scenarios, which makes the black-box adversarial attack problems practical and challenging. In fact, they can be formulated as high-dimensional black-box optimization problems at the pixel level. Although evolutionary algorithms are well known for solving black-box optimization problems, they cannot efficiently deal with the high-dimensional decision space. Therefore, we propose an approximated gradient sign method using differential evolution (DE) for solving black-box adversarial attack problems. Unlike most existing methods, it is novel that the proposed method searches the gradient sign rather than the perturbation by a DE algorithm. Also, we transform the pixel-based decision space into a dimension-reduced decision space by combining the pixel differences from the input image to neighbor images, and two different techniques for selecting neighbor images are introduced to build the transferred decision space. In addition, six variants of the proposed method are designed according to the different neighborhood selection and optimization search strategies. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is compared with a number of the state-of-the-art adversarial attack algorithms on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method shows superior performance for solving black-box adversarial attack problems, especially nontargeted attack problems.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3151373","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976165); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9714259","Adversarial attack;black box;deep neural networks (DNNs);differential evolution (DE)","Perturbation methods;Optimization;Convolutional neural networks;Evolutionary computation;Technological innovation;Predictive models;Neural networks","evolutionary computation;gradient methods;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;search problems","differential evolution;black-box adversarial attack problems;pixel-based decision space;input image;state-of-the-art adversarial attack algorithms;nontargeted attack problems;approximated gradient sign method;adversarial attacks;existing white-box attack methods;black-box optimization problems;high-dimensional decision space","","11","","68","IEEE","15 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Recombinator-k-Means: An Evolutionary Algorithm That Exploits k-Means++ for Recombination","C. Baldassi","Artificial Intelligence Lab, Bocconi University, Milan, Italy","IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","30 Sep 2022","2022","26","5","991","1003","We introduce an evolutionary algorithm called recombinator- $k$ -means for optimizing the highly nonconvex kmeans problem. Its defining feature is that its crossover step involves all the members of the current generation, stochastically recombining them with a repurposed variant of the  $k$ -means++ seeding algorithm. The recombination also uses a reweighting mechanism that realizes a progressively sharper stochastic selection policy and ensures that the population eventually coalesces into a single solution. We compare this scheme with a state-of-the-art alternative, a more standard genetic algorithm with deterministic pairwise-nearest-neighbor crossover and an elitist selection policy, of which we also provide an augmented and efficient implementation. Extensive tests on large and challenging datasets (both synthetic and real word) show that for fixed population sizes recombinator- $k$ -means is generally superior in terms of the optimization objective, at the cost of a more expensive crossover step. When adjusting the population sizes of the two algorithms to match their running times, we find that for short times the (augmented) pairwise-nearest-neighbor method is always superior, while at longer times recombinator- $k$ -means will match it and, on the most difficult examples, take over. We conclude that the reweighted whole-population recombination is more costly but generally better at escaping local minima. Moreover, it is algorithmically simpler and more general (it could be applied even to  $k$ -medians or  $k$ -medoids, for example).

Without domain knowledge, it is challenging to determine which features are useful. Feature selection is an effective preprocessing technique for enhancing the discriminating ability of data, but it is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem because of the challenges of the huge search space and complex interactions between features. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been successfully applied to feature selection due to its efficiency and easy implementation. However, most existing PSO-based feature selection methods still face the problem of falling into local optima. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel PSO-based feature selection approach, which can continuously improve the quality of the population at each iteration. Specifically, a correlation-guided updating strategy based on the characteristic of data is developed, which can effectively use the information of the current population to generate more promising solutions. In addition, a particle selection strategy based on a surrogate technique is presented, which can efficiently select particles with better performance in both convergence and diversity to form a new population. Experimental comparing the proposed approach with a few state-of-the-art feature selection methods on 25 classification problems demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to select a smaller feature subset with higher classification accuracy in most cases.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3134804","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61922072,61876169,62106230,61773242,61803227); Major Agricultural Applied Technological Innovation Projects of Shandong Province(grant numbers:SD2019NJ014); Shandong Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:ZR2019MF064); Intelligent Robot and System Innovation Center Foundation(grant numbers:2019IRS19); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021T140616,2021M692920); Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1913,VUW1914); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge (SfTI) Fund(grant numbers:E3603/2903); University Research Fund at Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:223805/3986); MBIE Data Science SSIF Fund(grant numbers:RTVU1914); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9647020","Classification;correlation;feature selection;particle swarm optimization (PSO);surrogate","Feature extraction;Correlation;Sociology;Classification algorithms;Optimization;Search problems;Particle swarm optimization","combinatorial mathematics;feature selection;particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;search problems","surrogate-assisted particle swarm optimization;data classification;combinatorial optimization problem;PSO-based feature selection approach","","15","","59","IEEE","13 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, a knee-based lower upper bound estimation method (K-LUBE) is proposed to construct wind speed prediction intervals (PIs). First, we analyze the underlying limitations of traditional direct interval forecast methods, i.e., their obtained PIs often fail to achieve a good balance between the interval width and the coverage probability. K-LUBE resolves the difficulty based on a multiobjective optimization framework in conjunction with a knee selection criterion. Specifically, a PI-NSGA-II multiobjective optimization algorithm is designed to obtain a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. A parameter transfer and a sample training strategies are developed to significantly improve the convergence speed of the optimization procedure. Then, the knee selection criterion is introduced to select the best tradeoff solution among the obtained solutions. In comparison with traditional methods, this method can always provide a reliable PI for decision makers. The procedure is automatic and requires no parameter to be specified in advance, making it more practical for use. The effectiveness of the proposed K-LUBE method is demonstrated through extensive comparisons with four traditional direct interval forecast methods and four classical benchmark models.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3122191","National Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars(grant numbers:62122093); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72071205); Ji-Hua Laboratory Scientific Project(grant numbers:X210101UZ210); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9585061","Knee;multiobjective optimization;neural network (NN);prediction interval (PI);wind speed","Forecasting;Wind speed;Wind forecasting;Pareto optimization;Artificial neural networks;Probabilistic logic;Estimation","decision making;evolutionary computation;genetic algorithms;neural nets;Pareto optimisation;power engineering computing;probability;set theory;wind power plants","decision makers;wind speed prediction intervals;interval width;knee selection criterion;PI-NSGA-II multiobjective optimization algorithm;Pareto-optimal solutions;convergence speed;K-LUBE method;evolutionary multiobjective knee-based lower upper bound estimation method;wind speed interval forecast;direct interval forecast methods;K-LUBE","","6","","46","IEEE","22 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In execution, four modules cooperate with each other and search agents co-evolve in a distributed way. This DCMA evolutionary framework provides some guidance in algorithm construction of different optimization problems. Furthermore, we design each module based on problem knowledge and follow the DCMA framework to propose a specific DCMA metaheuristic for coping with DHDFSP.

Particularly, a conical area EA (CAEA) was developed to heighten the convergence and population diversity of decomposition-based algorithms for bi-objective optimization by employing a cone decomposition approach. The global Pareto optimality of cone decomposition was proved. It means that the optimum of every conical subproblem of the cone decomposition approach is Pareto optimal in the entire bi-objective space in the presence of a continuous frontier segment within its associated subregion. In this article, based on the global Pareto optimality, we further reveal that the cone decomposition approach also has a desired ability of  $\mu $ -distribution convergence for bi-objective optimization. We first prove by the monotonicity and additivity of the Lebesgue measure and the squeeze theorem for limits that the hypervolume of the optimal solutions of all  $\mu $  subproblems of the cone decomposition approach is infinitely close to that of the optimal  $\mu $ -distribution for large enough  $\mu $  in the presence of a continuous frontier. Meanwhile, the original CAEA is further improved to better approximate the optimal solutions of conical subproblems. The experimental results on bi-objective benchmark problems show that the improved CAEA achieves higher qualities of frontiers and better  $\mu $ -distribution convergence in the terms of hypervolume error compared with six other popular multiobjective algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3146316","Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China(grant numbers:2020A1515011491,2020A1515010784,2019A1515011792); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou City(grant numbers:202102080161,2014J2200052); Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B020219003); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC0831100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61203310); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9691470","Bi-objective optimization;decomposition;evolutionary algorithm (EA);optimal μ-distribution;Pareto frontier (PF)","Optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Convergence;Evolutionary computation;Pareto optimization;Sorting","evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation","optimal solutions;conical subproblem;bi-objective benchmark problems;μ-distribution convergence;conical area evolutionary algorithm;bi-objective optimization;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;conical area EA;decomposition-based algorithms;cone decomposition approach;global Pareto optimality;multiobjective algorithms","","2","","39","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, the direct search for complete task-dependent network architectures is laborious since training and evaluating complete neural architectures over a large search space are computationally prohibitive. Recently, one-shot NAS (OSNAS) has attracted great attention in the NAS community because it significantly speeds up the candidate architecture evaluation procedure through weight sharing. However, the full weight sharing training paradigm in OSNAS may result in strong interference across candidate architectures and mislead the architecture search. To alleviate the problem, we propose a partial weight sharing OSNAS framework that directly evolves complete neural network architectures. In particular, we suggest a novel node representation scheme that randomly activates a subset of nodes of the one-shot model in each generation to reduce the weight coupling in the one-shot model. During the evolutionary search, a tailored crossover operator randomly samples the nodes from two parent individuals or a single parent to construct new candidate architectures, thus effectively constraining the degree of weight sharing. Furthermore, we introduce a new mutation operator that replaces the chosen nodes of the one-shot model with randomly generated nodes to enhance the exploratory capability. Finally, we encode a set of pyramidal convolution operations in the search space, enabling the evolved neural networks to capture different levels of details in the images. The proposed method is examined and compared with 26 state-of-the-art algorithms on ten image classification tasks, including CIFAR series, CINIC10, ImageNet, and MedMNIST series. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can computationally much more efficiently find neural architectures that achieve comparable classification accuracy to the state-of-the-art designs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3140855","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and Graduate Student Innovation Fund of Donghua University(grant numbers:CUSF-DH-D-2021047); Alexander von Humboldt Professorship for Artificial Intelligence endowed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9672175","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);evolutionary optimization;image classification;one-shot neural architecture search (OSNAS);pyramidal convolution (PyConv) operations","Computer architecture;Training;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Network architecture;Switches","computational complexity;convolution;evolutionary computation;genetic algorithms;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture;neural nets;search problems","evolutionary search;complete neural network architectures;partial weight sharing;neural architecture search;direct search;complete task-dependent network architectures;evaluating complete neural architectures;search space;one-shot NAS;OSNAS;candidate architecture evaluation procedure;weight sharing training paradigm;candidate architectures;one-shot model;weight coupling;tailored crossover operator randomly samples;randomly generated nodes;evolved neural networks","","8","","73","IEEE","6 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the SAEAs still face difficulties in solving expensive FS problems due to their high-dimensional discrete decision variables. To address this issue, we propose an SAEA with parallel random grouping for expensive FS problems, in which three main components consist. First, a constraint-based sampling strategy is proposed, which considers the influence of the constraint boundary and the number of selected features. Second, a high-dimensional FS problem is randomly divided into several low-dimensional subproblems. Surrogate models are then constructed in these low-dimensional decision spaces. After that, all the subproblems are optimized in parallel. The process of random grouping and parallel optimization continues until the termination condition is met. Finally, a final solution is chosen from the best solution in the historical search and the best solution in the last population using a random, distance-, or voting-based method.

Recently, there are a number of promising algorithms proposed based on transfer learning methods to solve DMOPs. However, it is very challenging to reduce the negative effect in transfer learning and find more effective transferred solutions. To fill this research gap, this article proposes a clustering-based transfer (CBT) learning method to solve DMOPs. When the environment changes, two novel operations (clustering-based selection (CBS) and CBT) are used to guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, CBS aims to find a population with nondominated solutions and dominated solutions as the training data for the new environment. Then, CBT further collects the previous Pareto-optimal solutions and some noise solutions as the training data for the previous environment. Two training data sets from different environments are, respectively, divided into multiple clusters and transfer learning is conducted on two similar clusters with high probability to reduce the negative effect, which can train an accurate prediction model to identify the promising solutions for the new environment. Empirical studies have been conducted on 14 benchmark DMOPs and one real-life path planning problem of unmanned air/ground vehicles, which validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Especially, our method can significantly reduce negative transfer on 12 out of 14 cases when compared with direct transfer learning.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3144180","National Key Research and Development Project, Ministry of Science and Technology, China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101301); Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Key Program Grant(grant numbers:U1713212); NSFC(grant numbers:61876110,61876162,61836005); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR(grant numbers:PolyU11202418,PolyU11209219); Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20190808164211203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684563","Clustering;dynamic multiobjective optimization;evolutionary algorithms (EAs);knowledge transfer;path planning","Transfer learning;Optimization;Task analysis;Statistics;Sociology;Predictive models;Vehicle dynamics","learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern clustering;probability","knowledge transfer;CBS;training datasets;DMOP;negative transfer learning;dynamic multiobjective optimization problems;clustering-based transfer learning;CBT learning;clustering-based selection;probability;clustering","","5","","69","IEEE","18 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This similarity may facilitate the transfer of functional knowledge between model species and human. Multiple network alignment is the process of uncovering the connection similarity between three or more networks simultaneously. Existing algorithms for multiple network alignment rely on sequence similarities to help drive the alignments, and no comprehensive study has been done to determine the most effective ways to utilize network connectivity—network topology—to drive multiple network alignment. Here, we devise and empirically test the efficacy of several measures of topological similarity between three or more networks.

However, most of the existing constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) cannot effectively explore and exploit those solutions and, therefore, exhibit poor performance when facing problems with large infeasible regions. To address the issue, this article proposes a novel method, called DD-CMOEA, which features dual stages (i.e., exploration and exploitation) and dual populations. Specifically, the two populations, called mainPop and auxPop, first individually evolve with and without considering the constraints, responsible for exploring feasible and infeasible solutions, respectively. Then, in the exploitation stage, mainPop provides information about the location of feasible regions, which facilitates auxPop to find and exploit surrounding infeasible solutions. The promising infeasible solutions obtained by auxPop in turn help mainPop converge better toward the Pareto-optimal front. Extensive experiments on three well-known test suites and a real-world case study fully demonstrate that DD-CMOEA is more competitive than five state-of-the-art CMOEAs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3131124","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61773390,72071205,61876075); Hunan Youth Elite Program(grant numbers:2018RS3081); National Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars(grant numbers:62122093); Scientific Key Research Project of National University of Defense Technology(grant numbers:ZZKY-ZX-11-04); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); Stable Support Plan Program of Shenzhen Natural Science Fund(grant numbers:20200925174447003); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627876","Coevolution;constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs);exploitation;exploration","Statistics;Sociology;Optimization;Search problems;Evolutionary computation;Convergence;Switches","evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation","constrained multiobjective optimization;informative infeasible solutions;constrained multiobjective optimization problems;constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;exploitation stage;feasible regions;Pareto-optimal front;dual-stage dual-population evolutionary algorithm;CMOPs;DD-CMOEA;mainPop;auxPop","","12","","38","IEEE","29 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the past few decades, various techniques have been developed to deal with linear and nonlinear constraints. However, reaching feasible solutions has been a challenging task for most of these methods. In this article, we adopt the framework of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) and propose a new algorithm (EDA++) equipped with some mechanisms to deal with nonlinear constraints. These mechanisms are associated with different stages of the EDA, including seeding, learning, and mapping. It is shown that, besides increasing the quality of the solutions in terms of objective values, the feasibility of the final solutions is guaranteed if an initial population of feasible solutions is seeded to the algorithm. The EDA with the proposed mechanisms is applied to two suites of benchmark problems for constrained continuous optimization and its performance is compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms and constraint-handling methods. Conducted experiments confirm the speed, robustness, and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in tackling various problems with linear and nonlinear constraints.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3153933","La Caixa Foundation Fellowship; Basque Government(grant numbers:BERC 2022–2025); Elkartek Programs(grant numbers:KK-2020/00049); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO: BCAM Severo Ochoa Excellence Accreditation(grant numbers:SEV-2017-0718); Spanish Ministry of Science(grant numbers:PID2019-106453GA-I00/AEI/10.13039/501100011033); Basque Government consolidated Groups 2019–2021(grant numbers:IT1244-19); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9721397","Clustering;continuous optimization;estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs);mapping;nonlinear constraints;seeding","Statistics;Sociology;Optimization;Probabilistic logic;Computational modeling;Codes;Mathematical models","constraint handling;optimisation","EDA++;nonlinear constraints;constrained continuous optimization;constraint-handling methods;distribution algorithms;feasibility conserving mechanisms;estimation of distribution algorithms","","6","","23","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Building cheap surrogate models to replace the expensive real models has been proved to be a practical way to reduce the number of costly evaluations. Supervised learning techniques from the community of machine learning have been widely applied to build either regressors, which approximate the fitness values of candidate solutions, or classifiers, which estimate the categories of candidate solutions. Considering the characteristics of the data produced in optimization, this article proposes a new surrogate model, called a relation model, for evolutionary multiobjective optimization. Instead of estimating the qualities of candidate solutions directly, the relation model tries to estimate the relationship between a pair of solutions  $\langle \mathbf {x}, \mathbf {y}\rangle $ , i.e.,  $\mathbf {x}$  dominates  $\mathbf {y}$ ,  $\mathbf {x}$  is dominated by  $\mathbf {y}$ , or  $\mathbf {x}$  is nondominated with  $\mathbf {y}$  in the case of multiobjective optimization. To implement this idea, first a balanced training set is prepared, then a classifier is built based on the training data set to learn the relationship, and finally, the classifier with a voting-scoring strategy is applied to estimate the relationship between the candidate solutions and parent solutions. By this way, the promising candidate solutions are recognized and evaluated by the real models. The new approach is applied to three well-known benchmark suites and two real-world applications, and the experimental results suggest that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods based on regression and classification models on the given instances.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3152582","Scientific and Technological Innovation 2030 Major Projects(grant numbers:2018AAA0100902); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:19511120601); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61731009,61907015,62106076); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(grant numbers:21ZR1420300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9716917","Expensive optimization;multiobjective optimization;relation model;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (SAEA)","Optimization;Computational modeling;Data models;Training data;Pareto optimization;Training;Predictive models","evolutionary computation;optimisation;pattern classification;supervised learning","relation learning;machine learning;classifier;surrogate model;relation model;evolutionary multiobjective optimization;parent solutions;regression;classification models;supervised learning","","9","","67","IEEE","18 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To illuminate the elite solutions for a space of behaviors, QD algorithms require the definition of a suitable behavior space. If the behavior space is high-dimensional, a suitable dimensionality reduction technique is required to maintain a limited number of behavioral niches. While current methodologies for automated behavior spaces focus on changing the geometry of the behavior space or on unsupervised learning of its key features, there remains a need for customizing behavioral diversity to a particular meta-objective specified by the end user. In the newly emerging framework of QD Meta-Evolution, or QD-Meta for short, one evolves a population of QD algorithms, each with different algorithmic and representational characteristics, to optimize the algorithms and their resulting archives to a user-defined meta-objective. Despite promising results compared to traditional QD algorithms, QD-Meta has yet to be compared to state-of-the-art behavior space automation methods, such as centroidal voronoi tessellations multidimensional archive of phenotypic elites (CVT-MAP-Elites) and autonomous robots realizing their abilities (AURORAs). This article performs an empirical study of QD-Meta on function optimization and multilegged robot locomotion benchmarks. Results demonstrate that QD-Meta archives provide improved average performance and faster adaptation to a priori unknown changes to the environment when compared to CVT-MAP-Elites and AURORA. A qualitative analysis shows how the resulting archives are tailored to the meta-objectives provided by the end user.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3152384","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council under the New Investigator Award(grant numbers:EP/R030073/1); UKRI Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Hub(grant numbers:EP/V00784X/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9716036","Evolutionary robotics;meta-evolution;quality-diversity (QD) algorithms","Databases;Statistics;Sociology;Robots;Magnetosphere;Ion radiation effects;Genetics","computational geometry;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);legged locomotion;mobile robots;optimisation;unsupervised learning","elite solutions;suitable behavior space;suitable dimensionality reduction technique;behavioral niches;automated behavior spaces;customizing behavioral diversity;particular meta-objective;QD Meta-Evolution;different algorithmic characteristics;representational characteristics;resulting archives;user-defined meta-objective;traditional QD algorithms;state-of-the-art behavior space automation methods;CVT-MAP-Elites;QD-Meta archives;meta-objectives;quality-diversity Meta-Evolution;quality-diversity algorithms","","","","40","IEEE","17 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The accuracy of the approximated solutions depends on the surrogates and approximations typically involve uncertainties. In this article, we propose probabilistic selection approaches that utilize the uncertainty information of the Kriging models (as surrogates) to improve the solution process in offline data-driven multiobjective optimization. These approaches are designed for decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and can, thus, handle a large number of objectives. The proposed approaches were tested on distance-based visualizable test problems and the DTLZ suite.

However, estimating the operator coefficients from input data is a nonlinear and compute-intensive optimization problem. We propose a new method for this estimation based on a recently developed efficiency-improved genetic algorithm. We demonstrate that it delivers an excellent balance between improved data quality and computational efficiency. We also introduce a “spatial consistency” feature to further speed up the algorithm by using available nonlinear-beamforming operators as initial trial solutions for the neighboring data ensembles.
