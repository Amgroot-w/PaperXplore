EAs are population-based methods inspired by principles of natural evolution that have provided a gradient-free path to solving complex learning and optimization problems. However, unlike the natural world where evolution has engendered diverse species and produced differently skilled subpopulations, in silico EAs are typically designed to evolve a set of solutions specialized for just a single target task. This convention of problem solving in isolation tends to curtail the power of implicit parallelism of a population. Skills evolved for a given problem instance do not naturally transfer to populations tasked to solve another. Hence, convergence rates remain restrained, even in settings where related tasks with overlapping search spaces, similar optimal solutions, or with other forms of reusable information, are routinely recurring.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3156325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745107","","","","","","","","0","IEEE","30 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The multitask approach pushes further the parallelization aspect of these algorithms by solving simultaneously multiple optimization tasks using a single population. During the search, the operators implicitly transfer knowledge between solutions to the offspring, taking advantage of potential synergies between problems to drive the solutions to optimality. Nevertheless, in order to operate on the individuals, the design space of each task has to be mapped to a common search space, which is challenging in engineering cases without clear semantic overlap between parameters. Here, we apply a 3-D point cloud autoencoder to map the representations from the Cartesian to a unified design representation: the latent space of the autoencoder. The transfer of latent space features between design representations allows the reconstruction of shapes with interpolated characteristics and maintenance of common parts, which potentially improves the performance of the designs in one or more tasks during the optimization. Compared to traditional representations for shape optimization, such as free-form deformation, the latent representation enables more representative design modifications, while keeping the baseline characteristics of the learned classes of objects. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in an optimization scenario where we minimize the aerodynamic drag of two different car shapes with common underbodies for cost-efficient vehicle platform design.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3086308","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:766186 (ECOLE)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9446541","Automotive engineering;commonality;evolutionary multitask optimization;point cloud autoencoder","Task analysis;Optimization;Three-dimensional displays;Shape;Statistics;Sociology;Knowledge transfer","evolutionary computation;image representation;optimisation;search problems;solid modelling","3-D point cloud autoencoder;unified representation;design representations;search operators;evolutionary optimization algorithms;multitask approach;operators implicitly transfer knowledge;design space;common search space;latent space features;latent representation;car shapes;cost-efficient vehicle platform design;multitask shape optimization","","9","","49","CCBYNCND","3 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Image feature learning can be considered as a multitask learning problem because different tasks may have a similar feature space. Genetic programming (GP) has been successfully applied to image feature learning for classification. However, most of the existing GP methods solve one task, independently, using sufficient training data. No multitask GP method has been developed for image feature learning. Therefore, this article develops a multitask GP approach to image feature learning for classification with limited training data. Owing to the flexible representation of GP, a new knowledge sharing mechanism based on a new individual representation is developed to allow GP to automatically learn what to share across two tasks and to improve its learning performance. The shared knowledge is encoded as a common tree, which can represent the common/general features of two tasks. With the new individual representation, each task is solved using the features extracted from a common tree and a task-specific tree representing task-specific features. To find the best common and task-specific trees, a new evolutionary search process and fitness functions are developed. The performance of the new approach is examined on six multitask learning problems of 12 image classification datasets with limited training data and compared with 17 competitive methods. The experimental results show that the new approach outperforms these comparison methods in almost all the comparisons. Further analysis reveals that the new approach learns simple yet effective common trees with high effectiveness and transferability.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3097043","Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1913,VUW1914); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge (SfTI) Fund(grant numbers:E3603/2903); University Research Fund at Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:223805/3986); MBIE Data Science SSIF Fund(grant numbers:RTVU1914); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61876169); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9484082","Feature learning;genetic programming (GP);image classification;knowledge sharing;multitask learning","Task analysis;Feature extraction;Training;Training data;Optimization;Search problems;Genetic programming","evolutionary computation;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence)","task-specific tree representing task-specific features;multitask learning problem;multitask genetic programming approach;image feature learning;multitask GP method;multitask GP approach","","6","","61","IEEE","14 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most studies framed so far within this context have considered environments and tasks conceived in isolation, without any exchange of knowledge among related tasks. In this manuscript we present A-MFEA-RL, an adaptive version of the well-known MFEA algorithm whose search and inheritance operators are tailored for multitask reinforcement learning environments. Specifically, our approach includes crossover and inheritance mechanisms for refining the exchange of genetic material, which rely on the multilayered structure of modern deep-learning-based reinforcement learning models. In order to assess the performance of the proposed approach, we design an extensive experimental setup comprising multiple reinforcement learning environments of varying levels of complexity, over which the performance of A-MFEA-RL is compared to that furnished by alternative nonevolutionary multitask reinforcement learning approaches. As concluded from the discussion of the obtained results, A-MFEA-RL not only achieves competitive success rates over the simultaneously addressed tasks, but also fosters the exchange of knowledge among tasks that could be intuitively expected to keep a degree of synergistic relationship.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3083362","Basque Government through the ELKARTEK Program (3KIA Project)(grant numbers:KK-2020/00049); Basque Government through the ELKARTEK Program (3KIA Project)(grant numbers:KK-2020/00049); Consolidated Research Group MATHMODE (IT1294-19); Department of Education of the Basque Government; Spanish Government through (SMART-DaSCI)(grant numbers:TIN2017-89517-P); BBVA Foundation through Ayudas Fundación BBVA a Equipos de Investigación Científica 2018 call (DeepSCOP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439811","Evolutionary multitasking;multifactorial optimization (MFO);multitask reinforcement learning;neuroevolution (NE)","Task analysis;Reinforcement learning;Optimization;Neural networks;Adaptation models;Transfer learning;Multitasking","deep learning (artificial intelligence);evolutionary computation;optimisation;reinforcement learning;search problems","machine learning tasks;supervised learning;A-MFEA-RL;multitask reinforcement learning environments;inheritance mechanisms;adaptive multifactorial evolutionary optimization;search operators;genetic material exchange;nonevolutionary multitask reinforcement learning approaches;unsupervised learning;pattern clustering;deep-learning-based reinforcement learning models","","13","","64","IEEE","24 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Owing to the useful information provided by the simplified searching space, the performance of LSMOPs has been improved to some extent. However, it is worth noting that the original problem has changed after the variation, and there is thus no guarantee of the preservation of the original global or near-global optimum in the newly generated space. In this article, we propose to solve LSMOPs via a multivariation multifactorial evolutionary algorithm. In contrast to existing transformation-based methods, the proposed approach intends to conduct an evolutionary search on both the original space of the LSMOP and multiple simplified spaces constructed in a multivariation manner concurrently. In this way, useful traits found along the search can be seamlessly transferred from the simplified problem spaces to the original problem space toward efficient problem solving. Besides, since the evolutionary search is also performed in the original problem space, preserving the original global optimal solution can be guaranteed. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, comprehensive empirical studies are carried out on a set of LSMOPs with two to three objectives and 500–5000 variables.

In this article, an evolutionary multitasking (EMT)-based constrained multiobjective optimization (EMCMO) framework is developed to solve CMOPs. In EMCMO, the optimization of a CMOP is transformed into two related tasks: one task is for the original CMOP, and the other task is only for the objectives by ignoring all constraints. The main purpose of the second task is to continuously provide useful knowledge of objectives to the first task, thus facilitating solving the CMOP. Specially, the genes carried by parent individuals or offspring individuals are dynamically regarded as useful knowledge due to the different complementarities of the two tasks. Moreover, the useful knowledge is found by the designed tentative method and transferred to improve the performance of the two tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use EMT to solve CMOPs. To verify the performance of EMCMO, an instance of EMCMO is obtained by employing a genetic algorithm as the optimizer. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark test suites to verify the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Furthermore, compared with other state-of-the-art constrained multiobjective optimization algorithms, EMCMO can produce better or at least comparable performance.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3145582","National Natural Science Fund for Outstanding Young Scholars of China(grant numbers:61922072); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62176238,61806179,61876169,61976237); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M682347); Training Program of Young Backbone teachers in Colleges and universities in Henan Province(grant numbers:2020GGJS006); Henan Provincial Young Talents Lifting Project(grant numbers:2021HYTP007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9690609","Constrained multiobjective optimization;evolutionary multitasking (EMT);knowledge transfer;multitasking optimization problem","Task analysis;Optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Knowledge transfer;Multitasking;Numerical models","computability;constraint satisfaction problems;genetic algorithms","evolutionary algorithms;EMCMO;CMOP;parent individuals;offspring individuals;evolutionary multitasking optimization framework;EMT-based constrained multiobjective optimization algorithms;genetic algorithm;knowledge transfer","","38","","55","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A key challenge to EMTO is the occurrence of negative knowledge transfer between tasks, which becomes severer when the total number of tasks increases. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive EMTO (AEMTO) framework. This framework can adapt knowledge transfer frequency, knowledge source selection, and knowledge transfer intensity in a synergistic way to make the best use of knowledge transfer, especially when facing many tasks. We implement the proposed AEMTO framework and evaluate our implementation on three suites of MTO problems with 2, 10, and 50 tasks and one real-world MTO problem with 2000 tasks in comparison to several state-of-the-art EMTO methods with certain adaptation strategies regarding knowledge transfer and the single-task optimization counterpart of the proposed method.

Effective knowledge between tasks is transferred by taking advantage of the parallelism of population-based search. Without any prior knowledge about tasks, it is a challenging problem of how to adaptively transfer effective knowledge between tasks and reduce the impact of negative transfer in EMTO. However, these two issues are rarely studied simultaneously in the existing literature. Besides, in complex many-task environments, the potential relationships among individuals from highly diverse populations associated with tasks directly determine the effectiveness of cross-task knowledge transfer. Keeping those in mind, we propose a multitask evolutionary algorithm based on anomaly detection (MTEA-AD). Specifically, each task is assigned a population and an anomaly detection model. Each anomaly detection model is used to learn the relationship among individuals between the current task and the other tasks online. Individuals that may carry negative knowledge are identified as outliers, and candidate transferred individuals identified by the anomaly detection model are selected to assist the current task, which may carry common knowledge across the current task and other tasks. Furthermore, to realize the adaptive control of the degree of knowledge transfer, the successfully transferred individuals that survive to the next generation through the elitism are used to update the anomaly detection parameter. The fair competition between offspring and candidate transferred individuals can effectively reduce the risk of negative transfer. Finally, the empirical studies on a series of synthetic benchmarks and a practical study are conducted to verify the effectiveness of MTEA-AD. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposal can adaptively adjust the degree of knowledge transfer through the anomaly detection model to achieve highly competitive performance compared to several state-of-the-art EMTO methods.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3068157","Key Project of Science and Technology Innovation 2030 through by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101302); General Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61773300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9385398","Adaptive strategy;anomaly detection;evolutionary multitask optimization (EMTO);knowledge transfer;many-task optimization (MaTO)","Task analysis;Optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Knowledge transfer;Anomaly detection;Evolutionary computation","adaptive control;data handling;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence)","EMTO;many-task environments;cross-task knowledge transfer;multitask evolutionary algorithm;anomaly detection parameter;adaptive knowledge transfer;evolutionary multitask optimization;evolutionary computation community;population-based search;convergence characteristics;MTEA-AD","","26","","48","IEEE","24 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, as the number of tasks increases to the extent of many-task optimization, the knowledge transfer between tasks encounters more uncertainty and challenges, thereby resulting in degradation of optimization performance. To give full play to the many-task optimization framework and minimize the potential negative transfer, this article proposes an evolutionary many-task optimization algorithm based on a multisource knowledge transfer mechanism, namely, EMaTO-MKT. Particularly, in each iteration, EMaTO-MKT determines the probability of using knowledge transfer adaptively according to the evolution experience, and balances the self-evolution within each task and the knowledge transfer among tasks. To perform knowledge transfer, EMaTO-MKT selects multiple highly similar tasks in terms of maximum mean discrepancy as the learning sources for each task. Afterward, a knowledge transfer strategy based on local distribution estimation is applied to enable the learning from multiple sources.

It follows then that the many-objective optimization problem (MaOP) has become one of the most challenging topics in the field of intelligent optimization. Recently, the multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA) and its variations, which have shown excellent performance in knowledge transfer across related problems, may provide a new and effective way for solving MaOPs. In this article, a novel MFEA based on improved dynamical decomposition (MFEA/IDD), which integrates the advantages of multitasking optimization and decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms, is proposed. Specifically, in the improved dynamical decomposition strategy (IDD) method, the bi-pivot strategy is designed to provide a good mechanism for balancing between convergence and diversity instead of the single-pivot strategy. Furthermore, a novel MFEA-based approach embedding the IDD strategy is developed to reduce the total running time for solving multiple MaOPs simultaneously. Compared with seven state-of-the-art algorithms, the efficacy of our proposed method is validated experimentally on the benchmarks WFG, DTLZ, and MAF with three to ten objectives, along with a series of real-world cases. The results reveal that the MFEA/IDD is well placed in balancing convergence and diversity while reducing the total number of function evaluations for solving MaOPs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3135691","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51805059); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing(grant numbers:cstc2019jcyjmsxmX0080); Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:KJZDK202001501,KJCX2020051,KJZD-M202101501); Cooperation Project between Chongqing Municipal Undergraduate Universities and Institutes Affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:HZ2021015); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9651543","Improved dynamical decomposition (IDD);many-objective optimization;multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA)","Optimization;Task analysis;Evolutionary computation;Convergence;Statistics;Sociology;Heuristic algorithms","computational complexity;evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation;search problems","multifactorial evolutionary algorithm;many-objective optimization problem;multiobjective optimization;computational complexity;search spaces;intelligent optimization;decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms;improved dynamical decomposition strategy method;bi-pivot strategy;single-pivot strategy;MFEA-based approach;IDD strategy;multiple MaOPs;multitasking optimization","","4","","60","IEEE","15 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the  $\mu $  solutions are not always uniformly distributed on a single-line Pareto front in three dimensions. They are only uniform when the single-line Pareto front has one constant objective. In this article, we further investigate the hypervolume-optimal  $\mu $ -distribution in three dimensions. We consider the line-based and plane-based Pareto fronts. For the line-based Pareto fronts, we extend the single-line Pareto front to two-line and three-line Pareto fronts, where each line has one constant objective. For the plane-based Pareto fronts, the linear triangular and inverted triangular Pareto fronts are considered. First, we show that the  $\mu $  solutions are not always uniformly distributed on the line-based Pareto fronts. The uniformity depends on how the lines are combined. Then, we show that a uniform solution set on the plane-based Pareto front is not always optimal for hypervolume maximization. It is locally optimal with respect to a  $(\mu +1)$  selection scheme. Our results can help researchers in the community to better understand and utilize the hypervolume indicator.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3093114","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62002152,61876075); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); Stable Support Plan Program of Shenzhen Natural Science Fund(grant numbers:20200925174447003); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9467327","Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO);hypervolume indicator;optimal μ-distribution","Optimization;Convergence;Statistics;Sociology;Shape;Pareto optimization;Minimization","computational geometry;evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation","hypervolume-optimal μ-distribution;evolutionary multiobjective optimization field;linear Pareto front;single-line Pareto front;plane-based Pareto front;line-based Pareto fronts;three-line Pareto fronts;two-line Pareto fronts","","","","32","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One is that federated learning raises high demands on communication resources, since a large number of model parameters must be transmitted between the server and clients. The other challenge is that training large machine learning models such as deep neural networks in federated learning requires a large amount of computational resources, which may be unrealistic for edge devices such as mobile phones. The problem becomes worse when deep neural architecture search (NAS) is to be carried out in federated learning. To address the above challenges, we propose an evolutionary approach to real-time federated NAS that not only optimizes the model performance but also reduces the local payload. During the search, a double-sampling technique is introduced, in which for each individual, only a randomly sampled submodel is transmitted to a number of randomly sampled clients for training. This way, we effectively reduce computational and communication costs required for evolutionary optimization, making the proposed framework well suitable for real-time federated NAS.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3099448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9494459","AutoML;communication cost;deep neural networks (DNNs);federated learning;multiobjective evolutionary optimization;neural architecture search;real-time optimization","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Servers;Real-time systems;Collaborative work;Training;Optimization","data privacy;deep learning (artificial intelligence);evolutionary computation;neural net architecture;search problems","federated learning;distributed machine learning approach;deep neural architecture search;real-time federated NAS;real-time federated evolutionary neural architecture search;privacy preservation;deep neural networks;evolutionary optimization","","17","","81","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, we first introduce a cost value-based distance into the objective space, and then use this distance and the constraints to define an indicator to evaluate the contribution of each individual to exploring the promising areas. Theoretical studies show that the proposed indicator can effectively guide population to focus on exploring the promising areas without crowding in local areas. Accordingly, we propose a new constraint handling technique (CHT) based on this indicator. To further improve the diversity of population in the promising areas, the proposed indicator-based CHT divides the promising areas into multiple subregions, and then gives priority to removing the individuals with the worst fitness values in the densest subregions. We embed the indicator-based CHT in evolutionary algorithm and propose an indicator-based constrained multiobjective algorithm for solving CMOPs. Numerical experiments on several benchmark suites show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Compared with six state-of-the-art constrained evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms, the proposed algorithm performs better in dealing with different types of CMOPs, especially in those problems that the individuals are easy to appear in the local infeasible areas that dominate the constrained Pareto front fragments.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3089155","Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A1515011500,2019B1515120036,501200069); Programme of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A0505100056); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61773127); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454505","Constraint handling;evolutionary algorithm;indicator;multiobjective optimization","Statistics;Sociology;Optimization;Evolutionary computation;Uninterruptible power systems;Search problems;Constraint handling","constraint handling;evolutionary computation;optimisation;Pareto optimisation","constrained Pareto front fragments;cost value-based distance;indicator-based CHT;CMOPs;constraint handling technique;population diversity;fitness values;constrained evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms;indicator-based constrained multiobjective algorithm","","30","","41","IEEE","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This nested structure necessitates a large number of function evaluations for the solution methods, especially population-based metaheuristics such as evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Reducing this effort remains critical for practical uptake of bilevel EAs, particularly for computationally expensive problems where each solution evaluation may involve a significant cost. This letter aims to contribute toward this field by a novel and previously unexplored proposition that bilevel optimization problems can be posed as multifidelity optimization problems. The underpinning idea is that an informed judgment of how accurate the LL optimum estimate should be to confidently determine its ranking can significantly cut down redundant evaluations during the search. Toward this end, we propose an algorithm which learns the appropriate fidelity to evaluate a solution during the search based on the seen data, instead of resorting to an exhaustive LL optimization. Numerical experiments are conducted on a range of standard as well as more complex variants of the SMD test problems to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach when compared to state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3120111","Australian Research Council through Discovery(grant numbers:DP190101271); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9570806","Bilevel optimization;multifidelity (MF) optimization;surrogate-assisted optimization","Optimization;Hafnium;Computational modeling;Sociology;Search problems;Costs;Correlation","design engineering;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;search problems","multifidelity approach;limited computing budget;upper level problem;nested lower level problem;nested structure;function evaluations;population-based metaheuristics;evolutionary algorithms;bilevel EAs;computationally expensive problems;solution evaluation;bilevel optimization problems;multifidelity optimization problems;LL optimum estimate;redundant evaluations;exhaustive LL optimization;SMD test problems","","2","","44","IEEE","14 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
