Previous works have proposed a few commonly seen problem characteristics into this problem framework, such as the definition of disconnected Pareto sets and dominance resistant regions of the design space. The authors’ previous work has advanced this research further by providing a problem generator to automatically create user-defined problem instances featuring any combination of these problem features as well as newly introduced ones, such as landscape discontinuities, varying objective ranges, and neutrality. This work makes a number of additional contributions including the proposal of an enhanced, open-source feature-rich problem generator that can create user-defined problem instances exhibiting a range of problem features—some of which are newly introduced here or form extensions of existing features. A comprehensive validation of the problem generator is also provided using popular multiobjective optimization algorithms, and some problem generator settings to create instances exhibiting different challenges for an optimizer are identified.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3084119","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/N017846/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9440928","Benchmarking;evolutionary optimization;multiobjective test problems;test suite;visualization","Generators;Visualization;Optimization;Search problems;Task analysis;Sociology;Shape","behavioural sciences;evolutionary computation;Pareto optimisation;search problems","enhanced source feature-rich problem generator;open-source feature-rich problem generator;user-defined problem instances;multiobjective optimization algorithms;visualizable test problem generator;search behavior;distance-based many-objective optimization test problems;disconnected Pareto sets;dominance resistant regions","","10","","53","IEEE","26 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most recommenders unilaterally optimize the results from the buying customers’ views without considering expectations of other participants, e.g., merchants. Unfortunately, the expectations of customers and merchants in recommendation are different or even conflicted. Especially for popular group-trading markets, customers and merchants are competing in trading, i.e., customers want to meet their preferences or obtain gains with personal favorite items, while merchants want to recommend wholesale items with setting group-trading terms or conditions. In addition, some practical constraints are not fully considered by prior systems. In this article, we propose a cooperative–competitive evolutionary algorithm (i.e., CoEA) for the bidirectional recommendations in group-trading markets. Specifically, we, respectively, formalize two subproblems with designed objectives for two-sided participants in markets, and integrate the cooperative–competitive optimizations into one framework. Second, CoEA designs a binary encoding matrix for individual representation to integrate the two subproblems. Furthermore, by assembling game evolution process, CoEA designs cooperative–competitive evolution operators, i.e., the cooperative crossover and competitive mutation, which guide the solutions to equilibrium by, respectively, bridging communication between two populations of subproblems and optimizing distinctive objective in each population. Finally, we construct two real applications involving bidirectional recommendations, i.e., the group buying and P2P lending, and conduct extensive experiments with the real-world datasets. By comparing CoEA with several representative recommendation algorithms and evolutionary algorithms, the experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of CoEA.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3091615","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976001,61876184,62076001,72091210,72091214); University Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province(grant numbers:GXXT-2020-050); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:2008085QF309,1908085MF219); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9462540","Cooperative–competitive evolutionary algorithm (CoEA);equilibrium solution;group-trading markets;recommender systems","Integrated circuits;TV;Manganese;Data structures;Boolean functions","evolutionary computation;genetic algorithms;peer-to-peer computing;recommender systems","CoEA;representative recommendation algorithms;evolutionary algorithms;cooperative-competitive evolutionary algorithm;bidirectional recommendations;recommender systems;recommenders;buying customers;merchants;popular group-trading markets;personal favorite items;setting group-trading terms;prior systems;cooperative-competitive optimizations;cooperative-competitive evolution operators;competitive mutation;optimizing distinctive objective;group buying","","7","","88","IEEE","22 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article investigates how to find the robustness intervals of the goal solution in evolutionary robust optimization and formulates this as a bilevel optimization problem. Then, a novel algorithm framework is proposed to solve the bilevel problem: an efficient heuristic-based approach is developed to optimize the upper level task, while a global optimizer is utilized to tackle the lower level task. The proposed heuristic-based approach contains four key components: 1) peak detection; 2) peak allocation; 3) calculation of the next perturbation value; and 4) robustness interval fine-tuning, aiming to enhance the efficiency of searching for the target intervals. Finally, three types of artificial test problems and a practical problem are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm framework.

Genetic programming is considered a promising hyper-heuristic technique to automatically evolve routing policies that can make effective real-time decisions in an uncertain environment. Most existing research on genetic programming hyper-heuristic for the uncertain capacitated arc routing problem only focused on the test performance aspect. As a result, the routing policies evolved by genetic programming are usually too large and complex, and hard to comprehend. To evolve effective, smaller, and simpler routing policies, this article proposes a novel genetic programming approach, which simplifies the routing policies during the evolutionary process using a niching technique. The simplified routing policies are stored in an external archive. We also developed new elitism, parent selection, and breeding schemes for generating offspring from the original population and the archive. The experimental results show that the newly proposed approach can achieve significantly better test performance than the current state-of-the-art genetic programming algorithms for the uncertain capacitated arc routing problem. The evolved routing policies are smaller, and thus potentially more interpretable.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3095261","Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1509,VUW1614); Research Institute of Trustworthy Autonomous Systems; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); Program for University Key Laboratory of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017KSYS008); Victoria University of Wellington Ph.D. Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9475970","Capacitated arc routing;genetic programming;hyper-heuristic;program simplification;stochastic optimization","Routing;Task analysis;Optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Genetic programming;Vehicle dynamics","combinatorial mathematics;genetic algorithms;search problems;vehicle routing","uncertain capacitated arc routing problem;simplified routing policies;genetic programming algorithms;evolved routing policies;optimization problem;genetic programming hyper-heuristic technique;effective real-time decisions;uncertain environment;test performance aspect;evolutionary process;niching technique;external archive;test performance","","15","","79","IEEE","7 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike previous systems, our method is capable of directly producing 3-D printable objects, eliminating intermediate transformations and manual manipulation often necessary to ensure the 3-D form is printable. We devise fitness measures for optimizing 3-D printability and aesthetic complexity and use a covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategies algorithm (CMA-ES) to find 3-D forms that are both aesthetically interesting and physically printable using fused deposition modeling printing techniques. We investigate the system’s capabilities by evolving and 3-D printing objects at different levels of structural consistency, and assess the quality of the fitness measures presented to explore the design space of our generative system.

In this scheduling problem, each job consists of multiple parts and the jobs are divided into different types. The manufacturing of a job is comprised of three consecutive stages: 1) parts fabrication on first-stage parallel machines; 2) parts assembly on second-stage single machine; and 3) job differentiation on one of third-stage dedicated machines. We provide a mixed-integer programming model, derive three lower bounds, and further present the EAMA metaheuristic for HDFSP. The EAMA is initialized heuristically, and its global exploration is performed by a differential evolution, which includes three newly designed operators: 1) elite-driven discretized differential mutation; 2) probability crossover; and 3) biased selection. To enhance the local search, an external elite archive is set and evolved in parallel with global exploration by a meta-Lamarckian learning-based adaptive multistage local search and a variable length-based adaptive block-insertion local search. After the global exploration and local exploitation, an elite sharing strategy is used to exchange the excellent information between population and elite archive, and an adaptive restart strategy is used to diversify the population. The influence of parameter setting on EAMA is surveyed by using an improved design-of-experiment.

In this framework, the task of optimizing a set of lower level problems parameterized by upper level variables is conducted in a parallel manner. In the meanwhile, a transfer learning strategy is developed to improve the effectiveness of each lower level search (LLS) process. In practice, we implement two versions of the TLEA: the first version uses the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy and the second version uses the differential evolution as the evolutionary operator in lower level optimization. The experimental studies on two sets of widely used bilevel optimization benchmark problems are conducted, and the performance of the two TLEA implementations is compared to that of four well-established evolutionary bilevel optimization algorithms to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm framework.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3095313","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62006044,62076056); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A1515011500); Programme of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A0505100056); UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Future Leaders Fellowship(grant numbers:MR/S017062/1,EPSRC 2404317); Amazon Research Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9476019","Bilevel optimization;covariance matrix;differential evolution (DE);evolutionary algorithm (EA);transfer learning","Optimization;Transfer learning;Search problems;Task analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Covariance matrices;Approximation algorithms","covariance matrices;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;search problems","transfer learning-based parallel evolutionary algorithm framework;upper level variables;transfer learning strategy;lower level search process;covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy;evolutionary bilevel optimization algorithms;TLEA;LLS;differential evolution","","7","","50","IEEE","7 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Examples include feature selection, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, where candidate solutions in an outer optimization loop must be evaluated via a learning subsystem. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are prominent gradient-free methods to handle such tasks. However, EAs are known to pose steep computational challenges, especially when dealing with large-instance datasets. As opposed to prior works that often fall back on parallel computing hardware to resolve this big data problem of EAs, in this article, we propose a novel algorithm-centric solution based on evolutionary multitasking. Our approach involves the creation of a band of minions, i.e., small data proxies to the main target task, that are constructed by subsampling a fraction of the large dataset. We then combine the minions with the main task in a single multitask optimization framework, boosting evolutionary search by using small data to quickly optimize for the large dataset. Our key algorithmic contribution in this setting is to allocate computational resources to each of the tasks in a principled manner. The article considers wrapper-based feature selection as an illustrative case study of the broader idea of using multitasking to speedup outer loop evolutionary configurations of any ML subsystem. The experiments reveal that multitasking can indeed speedup baseline EAs, by more than 40% on some datasets.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3099289","Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) of Singapore, through the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology-Nanyang Technological University Collaborative Research Programme in Complex Systems; A*STAR Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS)—Towards Contextual and Intelligent Response Research Program, through the RIE2020 IAF-PP(grant numbers:A19C1a0018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9493747","Evolutionary machine learning (ML);evolutionary multitasking (EMT);feature selection;resource allocation","Task analysis;Optimization;Feature extraction;Search problems;Multitasking;Tuning;Sociology","evolutionary computation;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;search problems","evolutionary machine learning;machine learning pipeline;hyperparameter tuning;learning subsystem;evolutionary algorithms;parallel computing hardware;big data problem;evolutionary multitasking;data proxies;single multitask optimization framework;evolutionary search;wrapper-based feature selection;outer loop evolutionary configurations;ML subsystem;feature selection","","13","","59","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in the process of knowledge transfer, negative transfer is common because it is difficult to evaluate whether knowledge is effective for population evolution. Therefore, how to obtain and transfer the effective knowledge to curb the negative transfer is a challenging problem in MTO. To deal with this problem, a self-adjusting multitask particle swarm optimization (SA-MTPSO) algorithm is designed to improve the convergence performance in this article. First, a knowledge estimation metric, combining the decision space knowledge and the target space knowledge for each task, is designed to describe the effectiveness of knowledge. Then, the effective knowledge is obtained to promote the knowledge transfer process. Second, a self-adjusting knowledge transfer mechanism, based on the effective knowledge and the self-adjusting transfer method, is developed to achieve effective knowledge transfer. Then, the ineffective knowledge is removed to solve the negative transfer problem. Third, the convergence analysis is given to guarantee the effectiveness of the SA-MTPSO algorithm theoretically. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with some existing MTO algorithms.

Two classification-based surrogate models are used, which can predict the Pareto dominance relation and  $\theta $ -dominance relation between two solutions, respectively. To make such surrogates as accurate as possible, we formulate dominance prediction as an imbalanced classification problem and address this problem using deep learning techniques. Furthermore, to integrate the surrogates based on dominance prediction with multiobjective evolutionary optimization, we develop a two-stage preselection strategy. This strategy aims to select a promising solution to be evaluated among those produced by genetic operations, taking proper account of the balance between convergence and diversity. We conduct an empirical study on a number of well-known multiobjective and many-objective benchmark problems, over a relatively small number of function evaluations. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared with several representative surrogate-assisted algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3098257","John R.

They struggle to learn stable policies by failing to identify and disambiguate perceptually identical states in the environment that require different actions to reach a goal. As the agent often has only a local frame of reference, it cannot represent the global environment. Frame-of-reference-based learning is a feature of vertebrate intelligence that allows multiple simultaneous representations of an environment at different levels of abstraction. This enables the resolution of patterns that are made up of patterns that are made up of features. The evolutionary computation technique of learning classifier systems has shown promise in learning nested patterns in single-step domains. This work uses the frame-of-reference concept within a learning classifier system to learn stable policies in non-Markov multistep domains. Considering aliased states at a constituent level enables the system to place them appropriately in holistic-level policies. Instead of enumerating a huge search space, evolution computation empowers the novel system to evolve fitter rules and policies. The experimental results show that the novel system effectively solves complex aliasing patterns in non-Markov environments that have been challenging to artificial agents. For example, the novel system utilizes only 6.5, 3.71, and 3.22 steps to resolve Maze10, Littman57, and Woods102, respectively.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3102241","Science for Technological Innovation National Science Challenge, New Zealand; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9506922","Building blocks;cognitive neuroscience;frame of reference;learning classifier systems (LCSs);non-Markov mazes;perceptual aliasing","Markov processes;Task analysis;Evolutionary computation;Reinforcement learning;Navigation;Biological information theory;Tools","decision making;evolutionary computation;multi-agent systems;pattern classification;reinforcement learning","frame-of-reference-based learning;vertebrate intelligence;evolutionary computation;single-step domains;learning classifier system;nonMarkov multistep domains;holistic-level policies;artificial agents;perceptual aliasing;multistep decision-making tasks;reinforcement learning agents","","7","","70","CCBY","4 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most route planning algorithms consider only up to three objectives. In this article, we propose a scalable many-objective benchmark problem covering most of the important features for routing applications based on real-world data. We define five objective functions representing distance, traveling time, delays caused by accidents, and two route-specific features, such as curvature and elevation. We analyze several different instances for this test problem and provide their true Pareto front to analyze the problem difficulties. Additionally, we apply four well-known evolutionary multiobjective algorithms. Since this test benchmark can be easily transferred to real-world routing problems, we construct a routing problem from OpenStreetMap data. We evaluate the three optimization algorithms and observe that we are able to provide promising results for such a real-world application. The proposed benchmark represents a scalable many-objective route planning optimization problem enabling researchers and engineers to evaluate their many-objective approaches.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3089050","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research through the MOSAIK Project(grant numbers:01IS18070B); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453706","Benchmark;evolutionary algorithm;many-objective optimization;route finding","Benchmark testing;Planning;Backtracking;Roads;Optimization;Delays;Search problems","benchmark testing;evolutionary computation;genetic algorithms;mobile robots;optimisation;Pareto optimisation;path planning","many-objective pathfinding benchmark;mobile robotics;route planning algorithms;many-objective benchmark problem;real-world data;objective functions;route-specific features;test problem;problem difficulties;evolutionary multiobjective algorithms;test benchmark;real-world routing problems;routing problem;optimization algorithms;many-objective route planning optimization problem;many-objective approaches","","7","","50","IEEE","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
