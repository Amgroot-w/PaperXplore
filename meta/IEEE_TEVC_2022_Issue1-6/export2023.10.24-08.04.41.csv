Currently, there exist two types of comprehensive quality indicators (i.e., volume-based and distance-based indicators). Distance-based indicators, such as inverted generational distance (IGD), are usually computed by summing up the distance of each reference point to its nearest solution. Their high computational efficiency leads to their prevalence in many-objective optimization. However, in the existing distance-based indicators, the distributions of the solution sets are usually neglected, leading to their lack of ability to well distinguish between different solution sets. This phenomenon may become even more severe in high-dimensional space. To address such an issue, a kernel-based indicator (KBI) is proposed as a comprehensive indicator. Different from other distance-based indicators, a kernel-based maximum mean discrepancy is adopted in KBI for directly measuring the difference that can characterize the convergence, spread, and uniformity of two sets, i.e., the solution set and reference set, by embedding them in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). As a result, KBI not only reflects the distance between the solution set and the reference set but also can reflect the distribution of the solution set itself. In addition, to maintain the desirable weak Pareto compliance property of KBI, a nondominated set reconstruction approach is also proposed to shift the original solution set. The detailed theoretical and experimental analysis of KBI is provided in this article. The properties of KBI have also been analyzed by the optimal  $\mu $ -distribution.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3105565","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61732006,62072234,61473241); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1402900); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China(grant numbers:BK20181288); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2015M571751); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9515483","Kernel method;many-objective optimization;multiobjective optimization;quality evaluation","Optimization;Convergence;Kernel;Pareto optimization;Extraterrestrial measurements;Computer science;Visualization","evolutionary computation;Hilbert spaces;Pareto optimisation","KBI;kernel-based indicator;comprehensive quality indicators;inverted generational distance;solution sets;comprehensive indicator;kernel-based maximum mean discrepancy;many-objective optimization;distance-based indicators;volume-based indicators;reproducing kernel Hilbert space;RKHS;reference set;weak Pareto compliance property;nondominated set reconstruction approach","","2","","64","IEEE","17 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, for data with both the two characteristics above, there is still a lack of the corresponding FS algorithm. Due to the complex coupling relationship between missing data and class imbalance, the need for better FS method becomes essential. To tackle high-dimensional imbalanced data with missing values, this article studies a new evolutionary FS method. First, an improved  $F$ -measure based on filling risk (RF-measure) is defined to evaluate the influence of missing data on the performance of FS in the case of class imbalance. Following that taking the RF-measure as an objective function, a particle swarm optimization-based FS method with fuzzy clustering (PSOFS-FC) is proposed. Two new problem-specific operators or strategies, i.e., the swarm initialization strategy guided by fuzzy clustering and the local pruning operator based on feature importance, are developed to improve the performance of PSOFS-FC. Compared with state-of-the-art FS algorithms on several public datasets, experimental results show that PSOFS-FC can achieve excellent classification performance with relatively less running time, indicating its superiority on tackling high-dimensional imbalanced data with missing values.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3106975","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876185,61876184,61973305); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9521243","Class imbalance;feature selection (FS);fuzzy clustering;missing value;particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Particle swarm optimization;Mutual information;Search problems;Computational efficiency;Sun","feature selection;fuzzy set theory;particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;pattern clustering","PSOFS-FC;local pruning operator;problem-specific operators;particle swarm optimization-based FS method with fuzzy clustering;clustering-guided particle swarm feature selection algorithm;FS algorithm;class imbalance;RF-measure","","27","","74","IEEE","24 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, with the increased number of decision variables in EMOPs, the prediction accuracy of surrogate models will deteriorate, which inevitably worsens the performance of SAEAs. To deal with this issue, this article suggests an ensemble surrogate-based framework for tackling EMOPs. In this framework, a global surrogate model is trained under the entire search space to explore the global area, while a number of surrogate submodels are trained under different search subspaces to exploit the subarea, so as to enhance the prediction accuracy and reliability. Moreover, a new infill sampling criterion is designed based on a set of reference vectors to select promising samples for training the models. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our framework, three state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms [nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III), multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with differential evolution (MOEA/D-DE) and reference vector-guided evolutionary algorithm (RVEA)] are embedded, which significantly improve their performance for solving most of the test EMOPs adopted in this article.

To date, many CHTs, such as penalty function, superiority of feasible solutions, and  $\epsilon $ -constraint (EC), have been designed. However, different CHTs are usually suited to different problems, even the most appropriate technique changes along with the stages of the optimization process. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose a voting-mechanism-based ensemble framework, named voting mechanism for constraint handling (VMCH), to integrate multiple CHTs for solving various COPs. In this framework, each CHT acts as a voter, all voters vote for each pair of solutions, and the solution in each pair with the highest weighted votes is considered better. In addition, an adaptive strategy is developed to adjust the voter weights according to their historical voting performance. To investigate the performance of VMCH in improving existing algorithms, the proposed VMCH is embedded into the three best algorithms in the competition on constrained single objective real-parameter optimization at CEC 2018, namely, MAgES, iLSHADE $\epsilon $ , and IUDE, to form three new algorithm versions, i.e., MAgES-VMCH, iLSHADE $\epsilon $ -VMCH, and IUDE-VMCH. They are compared with seven state-of-the-art peer algorithms. Extensive experiments are conducted on 57 real-world COPs. The ranking results show that the new algorithm version MAgES-VMCH takes first place among the ten comparison algorithms. Moreover, all the new VMCH-enhanced versions of the three best algorithms are superior to their original versions. Therefore, the proposed VMCH framework can achieve competitive performance in solving COPs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3110130","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62073341); Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2019JJ20026); National Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2020JJ4748); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9528854","Constrained optimization;constraint handling technique (CHT);ensemble framework;voting mechanism","Optimization;Statistics;Sociology;Linear programming;Constraint handling;Partitioning algorithms;Convergence","constraint handling;evolutionary computation;optimisation","voting-mechanism-based ensemble framework;constraint handling techniques;evolutionary algorithms;constrained optimization problems;COP;ε-constraint;CHT;voter weights;historical voting performance;iLSHADEε-VMCH;IUDE-VMCH;peer algorithms;comparison algorithms;voting mechanism for constraint handling;adaptive strategy;constrained single objective real-parameter optimization;MAgES-VMCH","","20","","60","IEEE","3 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MaL algorithms can discover a much lower-dimensional representation (embedding) of a high-dimensional dataset through nonlinear transformations that preserve the most important structure of the original data. State-of-the-art MaL methods directly optimize an embedding without mapping between the original space and the discovered embedded space. This makes interpretability—a key requirement in exploratory data analysis—nearly impossible. Recently, genetic programming has emerged as a very promising approach to MaL by evolving functional mappings from the original space to an embedding. However, genetic programming-based MaL has struggled to match the performance of other approaches. In this work, we propose a new approach to using genetic programming for MaL, which preserves local topology. This is expected to significantly improve performance on tasks where local neighborhood structure (topology) is paramount. We compare our proposed approach with various baseline MaL methods and find that it often outperforms other methods, including a clear improvement over previous genetic programming approaches. These results are particularly promising, given the potential interpretability and reusability of the evolved mappings.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3106672","Marsden Fund of the New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1913,VUW1914); University Research Fund at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington(grant numbers:226161/4164); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9520652","Evolutionary learning;feature construction;feature selection;genetic programming (GP);manifold learning (MaL)","Topology;Manifold learning;Task analysis;Genetic programming;Manifolds;Computational modeling;Numerical models","data analysis;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","preserving local topology;manifold learning methods;invaluable tool;increasingly huge datasets;MaL algorithms;lower-dimensional representation;high-dimensional dataset;nonlinear transformations;important structure;state-of-the-art MaL methods;discovered embedded space;interpretability-a key requirement;exploratory data analysis;functional mappings;genetic programming-based MaL;local neighborhood structure;baseline MaL methods;previous genetic programming approaches;evolved mappings","","4","","45","IEEE","23 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The recently proposed autoencoder-embedded evolutionary optimization (AEO) framework is highly appropriate to deal with high-dimensional problems. This work aims to incorporate surrogate models into it to further boost its performance, thus resulting in surrogate-assisted AEO (SAEO). It proposes a novel model management strategy that can guarantee reasonable amounts of re-evaluations; hence, the accuracy of surrogate models can be enhanced via being updated with new evaluated samples. Moreover, to ensure enough data samples before constructing surrogates, a problem-dimensionality-dependent activation condition is developed for incorporating surrogates into the SAEO framework. SAEO is tested on seven commonly used benchmark functions and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms for HEPs. The experimental results show that SAEO can further enhance the performance of AEO on most cases and SAEO performs significantly better than other algorithms.

In recent years, evolutionary algorithms based on prediction models have been considered promising. However, most existing approaches only make predictions based on the linear correlation between a finite number of optimal solutions in two or three previous environments. These incomplete information extraction strategies may lead to low prediction accuracy in some instances. In this article, an incremental support vector machine (ISVM)-based dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, in short called ISVM-DMOEA, is proposed. We treat the solving of dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) as an online learning process, using the continuously obtained optimal solution to update an ISVM without discarding the solution information at earlier time. ISVM is then used to filter random solutions and generate an initial population for the next moment. To overcome the obstacle of insufficient training samples, a synthetic minority oversampling strategy is implemented before the training of ISVM. The advantage of this approach is that the nonlinear correlation between solutions can be explored online by ISVM, and the information contained in all historical optimal solutions can be exploited to a greater extent. The experimental results and comparison with the chosen state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively tackle DMOPs.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3115036","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61673328); Collaborative Project Foundation of Fuzhou-Xiamen- Quanzhou Innovation Demonstration Zone(grant numbers:3502ZCQXT202001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9546930","Evolutionary algorithm;incremental support vector machine (ISVM);multiobjective optimization;oversampling;prediction model","Optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Statistics;Sociology;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines;Evolutionary computation","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);Pareto optimisation;support vector machines","online prediction approach;real-world multiobjective optimization;Pareto-optimal front;environment changes;information extraction;incremental support vector machine;ISVM-DMOEA;dynamic multiobjective optimization problems;online learning process;dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm","","8","","55","IEEE","23 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the local search in MA needs to be carefully designed according to the problem’s characteristics. In this article, we consider a real-world large-scale waste collection problem with multiple depots, multiple disposal facilities, multiple trips, and working time constraints. Vehicles with a limited capacity and working time can start from different depots, collect waste at different sites, and make multiple trips to different disposal facilities to empty the waste and return to its origin. While the existing work considered problems with multiple trips and time constraints, none have tackled problems with multiple depots, multiple disposal facilities, multiple trips, as well as working time constraints. The change from “single-depot” to “multidepot” not only reflects better the situation in real life but also leads to a qualitative different and more complex problem. In this article, we first model this complex problem mathematically. Then, a novel region-focused MA is proposed to tackle this new challenge. Compared to classic MA, this region-focused one is enhanced by two major components: 1) a new heuristic-assisted solution initialization algorithm and 2) a region-focused local search with novel heuristics.

Many existing methods transfer task-specific knowledge, such as the high-quality solution from one task to other tasks to enhance the optimization ability, which, however, may not work well or even have a negative effect if the tasks have very different task-specific knowledge. Hence, this article proposes a meta-knowledge transfer (MKT)-based differential evolution (MKTDE) algorithm by using a more general MKT method to solve MTOPs more efficiently. The meta-knowledge defined in this article refers to the knowledge that can evolve task-specific knowledge during the evolutionary search. That is, the meta-knowledge is a kind of “knowledge of knowledge,” which denotes the knowledge of “how to solve problem via evolution” and “the feature/way/method of evolving high-quality solution.” The evolutionary search for solving different tasks can share common meta-knowledge even though these tasks involve heterogeneous data and have very different task-specific knowledge. Therefore, the MKT can associate the heterogeneous multisource data of different tasks via transferring the meta-knowledge to help solve MTOPs more efficiently in a more general way. Moreover, to further enhance the MKTDE, two novel and efficient methods are proposed. One is multiple populations for the multiple tasks framework using a unified search space for making knowledge transfer flexibly. The other is an elite solution transfer method for achieving positive high-quality solution transfer. The superior performance of the proposed MKTDE is verified via extensive numerical experiments on both widely used MTOP benchmark problems and real-world robot navigation problems, with comparisons with some state-of-the-art and the latest well-performing algorithms.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3131236","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2102102); National Natural Science Foundations of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62176094,61822602,61772207,61873097); Key-Area Research and Development of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B010166002); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation Research Team(grant numbers:2018B030312003); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2021H1D3A2A01082705); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627943","Evolutionary computation (EC);meta-knowledge transfer (MKT);multitask optimization problem (MTOP)","Task analysis;Statistics;Sociology;Optimization;Knowledge transfer;Search problems;Robots","evolutionary computation;knowledge management;mobile robots;optimisation;search problems","different task-specific knowledge;MTOPs;multiple tasks framework;elite solution transfer method;high-quality solution transfer;multitask optimization problems;meta-knowledge transfer-based differential evolution algorithm;general MKT method;evolutionary search;common meta-knowledge","","33","","73","CCBY","29 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article proposes an evolutionary approach to generate an oblique RF for regression problems. More specifically, our method induces an oblique RF by transforming the original feature space to a new feature space through the evolutionary feature construction method. To speed up the searching process, the proposed method evaluates each set of features based on a decision tree (DT) rather than an RF. In order to obtain an RF, we archive top-performing features and corresponding trees during the search. In this way, both the features and the forest can be constructed simultaneously in a single run. The proposed evolutionary forest is applied to 117 benchmark problems with different characteristics and compared with some state-of-the-art regression methods, including several variants of the RF and gradient boosted DTs (GBDTs).

Especially, in an EMO algorithm with an unbounded external archive (UEA), subset selection is an essential post-processing procedure to select a prespecified number of solutions as the final result. In this article, we discuss the efficiency of greedy subset selection for the hypervolume, inverted generational distance (IGD), and IGD plus (IGD+) indicators. Greedy algorithms usually efficiently handle the subset selection. However, when a large number of solutions are given (e.g., subset selection from tens of thousands of solutions in a UEA), they often become time consuming. Our idea is to use the submodular property, which is known for the hypervolume indicator, to improve their efficiency. First, we prove that the IGD and IGD+ indicators are also submodular. Next, based on the submodular property, we propose an efficient greedy inclusion algorithm for each indicator. We demonstrate through computational experiments that the proposed algorithms are much faster than the standard greedy subset selection algorithms. The proposed algorithms also help the research on performance indicators.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3103386","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62002152,61876075); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory(grant numbers:2020B121201001); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X386); Stable Support Plan Program of Shenzhen Natural Science Fund(grant numbers:20200925174447003); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:KQTD2016112514355531); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9509298","Evolutionary many-objective optimization;evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO);performance indicators;submodularity;subset selection","Optimization;Greedy algorithms;Statistics;Sociology;Approximation algorithms;Evolutionary computation;Clustering algorithms","evolutionary computation;greedy algorithms;set theory","fast greedy subset selection;candidate solution sets;evolutionary multiobjective optimization;IGD+ indicators;standard greedy subset selection algorithms;EMO;unbounded external archive;inverted generational distance;IGD plus indicators;hypervolume","","6","","60","IEEE","9 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Genetic programming (GP) is a promising approach to training routing policies to make real-time decisions and handle uncertain events effectively. In the real world, there are various problem domains and no single routing policy can work effectively in all of them. Instead of training in isolation, we can leverage the relatedness between the problems and transfer knowledge from previously solved source problems to solve the target problem. The existing transfer methods are not effective enough due to the loss of diversity during the knowledge transfer. To increase the diversity of the transferred knowledge, in this article, we propose a novel GP method that removes phenotypic duplicates from the source individuals to initialize the target individuals. Furthermore, assuming that the transferred knowledge used in initialization already includes all the important knowledge explored for the source problem, it is more effective to explore new regions that have not been explored for the source problem. Therefore, we propose novel genetic operators that prohibit the search from revisiting the source individuals when solving the target problem. To speed up the revisit check, we propose to adapt a powerful hashing method for routing policies that greatly improves the efficiency of the genetic operators. Our experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing GP approaches with knowledge transfer in terms of both initial and final solution quality.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3129278","Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government(grant numbers:VUW1509,VUW1614); Science for Technological Innovation Challenge (SfTI) Fund(grant numbers:E3603/2903); Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment (MBIE) Strategic Science Investment Fund (SSIF) Fund(grant numbers:VUW RTVU1914); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9621218","Arc routing;genetic programming (GP);guided search;hyperheuristics;transfer optimization","Routing;Task analysis;Genetic programming;Costs;Search problems;Statistics;Sociology","genetic algorithms;search problems","hashing method;GP method;guided search;source problem;uncertain events;training routing policies;uncertain capacitated arc routing problem;genetic programming;knowledge transfer;source individuals;genetic operators","","8","","79","IEEE","19 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in the real-world applications, we may face EOPs with discontinuous objective functions, which are also called EOPs with discontinuous responses (EOPDRs). Indeed, EOPDRs pose a great challenge to current SAEAs. In this article, a surrogate-assisted differential evolution (DE) algorithm with region division is proposed, named ReDSADE. ReDSADE includes three main strategies: 1) the region division strategy; 2) the Kriging-based search; and 3) the radial basis function (RBF)-based local search. In the region division strategy, we define a new distance measure, called the objective-decision distance. Based on this distance, the evaluated solutions are partitioned into several clusters, and several support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are trained to classify them. These SVM classifiers divide the decision space into several subregions, with the aim of making the objective function continuous in them. In the Kriging-based search, a Kriging model is established in each subregion and combined with DE to search for the optimal solution. In the RBF-based local search, DE is coupled with RBF to search around the best solution found so far, thus accelerating the convergence. By combining these three strategies, ReDSADE is able to solve EOPDRs with limited function evaluations. Three sets of test problems and a real-world application are utilized to verify the effectiveness of ReDSADE. The results demonstrate that ReDSADE exhibits good convergence accuracy and convergence speed.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3117990","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976225); Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Intelligent Robots and Systems(grant numbers:2018IRS06); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9559391","Differential evolution (DE);discontinuous response;expensive optimization problems (EOPs);region division;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs)","Linear programming;Support vector machines;Optimization;Kernel;Computational modeling;Iron;Convergence","evolutionary computation;mathematics computing;optimisation;pattern classification;radial basis function networks;search problems;support vector machines","region division strategy;Kriging-based search;radial basis function-based local search;distance measure;objective-decision distance;support vector machine classifiers;SVM classifiers;RBF-based local search;function evaluations;surrogate-assisted differential evolution;expensive optimization problems;discontinuous responses;surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms;continuous objective functions;discontinuous objective functions;SAEA;ReDSADE;EOPDR","","1","","48","IEEE","5 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For a given problem, a suitable genome representation must be defined along with a mutation operator to generate subsequent generations. Unlike natural systems, which display a variety of complex rearrangements (e.g., mobile genetic elements), mutation for genetic algorithms commonly utilizes only random pointwise changes. Furthermore, generalizing beyond pointwise mutations poses a key difficulty as useful genome rearrangements depend on the representation and problem domain. To move beyond the limitations of manually defined pointwise changes, here we propose the use of techniques from masked language models to automatically generate mutations. As a first step, common subsequences within a given population are used to generate a vocabulary. The vocabulary is then used to tokenize each genome. A masked language model is trained on the tokenized data in order to generate possible rearrangements (i.e., mutations). In order to illustrate the proposed strategy, we use string representations of molecules and use a genetic algorithm to optimize for drug-likeness and synthesizability. Our results show that moving beyond random pointwise mutations accelerates genetic algorithm optimization.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2022.3144045","Exascale Computing Project(grant numbers:17-SC-20-SC); a joint project of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science and National Nuclear Security Administration; Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer(grant numbers:JDACS4C); Program established; DOE and the NCI of the National Institutes of Health; DOE CARES emergency funding to the National Center for Computational Sciences at ORNL through the Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684551","Artificial intelligence;bioinformatics;genetic algorithms;machine learning","Genetic algorithms;Vocabulary;Training;Predictive models;Optimization;Tokenization;Bit error rate","genetic algorithms;genetics;genomics","generate solutions;optimization problems;scientific engineering disciplines;suitable genome representation;mutation operator;subsequent generations;natural systems;complex rearrangements;mobile genetic elements;random pointwise changes;useful genome rearrangements;manually defined pointwise changes;masked language model;common subsequences;random pointwise mutations;genetic algorithm optimization;automating genetic algorithm mutations;biological systems","","5","","46","IEEE","18 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
